    As you prepare to implement effective discussion question and content creation strategies in your teaching,
    consider this implementation framework:
    
    ### 1. Analyze Current Practice
    - Review your current approach to discussion questions and instructional materials
    - Identify areas where differentiation is most needed
    - Note which types of content take the most time to create
    
    ### 2. Prioritize Applications
    - Start with one type of content that would have the greatest impact
    - Focus on discussion questions for key topics or challenging concepts
    - Select units where more differentiated materials would benefit students
    
    ### 3. Create Prompt Templates
    - Develop framework prompts for your most common content needs
    - Save successful prompts as templates for future use
    - Create a personal library organized by content type and purpose
    
    ### 4. Integrate with Planning Routine
    - Establish a workflow for incorporating prompt engineering
    - Schedule time for review and refinement of generated content
    - Develop a system for organizing and accessing your materials
    
    This systematic approach helps you integrate new practices effectively while managing
    your time and maximizing the impact on student learning.

    st.markdown("""
    * **Cognitive levels matter** - Effective discussion questions target multiple levels of thinking and follow a logical sequence
      
    * **PCTFR framework enhances quality** - This comprehensive approach ensures generated questions and content are aligned with your specific context
      
    * **Differentiation requires specificity** - Clearly articulated differentiation strategies in prompts lead to more inclusive content
      
    * **Content format affects learning** - Different instructional formats serve different purposes; choose intentionally based on learning goals

    In our next lesson, we'll explore how to apply prompt engineering to create effective collaborative 
    learning experiences for students. This builds directly on what you've learned about discussion 
    questions and content creation:
    
    - **From discussion to collaboration:** The principles of crafting thought-provoking questions 
      transfer directly to designing collaborative tasks that promote meaningful interaction
    
    - **From content to activities:** The skills you've developed in creating instructional content 
      will help you design engaging collaborative activities with clear learning goals
    
    - **From individual to group learning:** You'll expand your prompt engineering toolkit to address 
      the unique challenges and opportunities of peer-to-peer learning
    
    As you move into Lesson 16, consider how collaborative learning builds on effective questions and 
    content to create powerful learning experiences for all students.

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share one prompt they've created that they're particularly proud of
    * Discuss how departments or grade-level teams might collaborate on creating a shared prompt library
    * Explore how these techniques might transform planning processes and time allocation
    * Consider how these skills might support new teachers or those teaching new content
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on Collaborative Learning Activities, make connections to this lesson by emphasizing:
    - How effective discussion questions form the foundation of productive group activities
    - The importance of well-designed instructional content in scaffolding collaborative work
    - The transferability of differentiation strategies to group learning contexts
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding and application plans. Look for:
    - Specific mention of prompt components they found most valuable
    - Concrete plans for implementation in their own context
    - Recognition of the connection between quality questions/content and student outcomes

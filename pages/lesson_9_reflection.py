    Zero-shot prompting is the first of several advanced techniques we'll explore:
    
    - **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Using the model's existing knowledge without examples (this lesson)
    
    - **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing a few examples to guide the model's responses (next lesson)
    
    - **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Guiding the model through step-by-step reasoning
    
    - **Role Prompting**: Using rich persona descriptions to shape responses
    
    These techniques complement the PTC-FREI framework, giving you a comprehensive toolkit for 
    prompt engineering in educational contexts.

    st.markdown("""
    * **Zero-shot works with common educational tasks**: The model already has knowledge of standard educational content and formats
      
    * **Specificity matters**: Clear parameters guide the model without requiring examples
      
    * **Educational terminology helps**: Using terms like "formative assessment" or "differentiation" taps into specialized knowledge
      
    * **Structure improves results**: Organizing requirements as numbered lists increases clarity
      
    * **PCTFREI elements enhance zero-shot**: You can incorporate PCTFREI framework elements even in zero-shot prompts

    You now have a powerful technique for quickly generating educational content without needing to provide examples.

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share their most valuable insight about zero-shot prompting
    * Discuss situations where zero-shot might not be sufficient and why
    * Explore how zero-shot could be integrated into their existing lesson planning workflow
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on Few-Shot Prompting, make connections to this lesson by emphasizing:
    - How few-shot builds on zero-shot when more control is needed
    - The balance between simplicity (zero-shot) and specificity (few-shot)
    - Situations where each approach might be preferred
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding of zero-shot prompting. Look for:
    - Appropriate identification of content types well-suited to zero-shot
    - Effective prompt construction with clear parameters
    - Thoughtful comparison between zero-shot and the PCTFREI framework

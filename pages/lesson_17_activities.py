    3. **Choice boards** provide structured options that increase student engagement and agency 
       while ensuring alignment with learning objectives.
    
    4. **Adaptive pathways** create responsive learning experiences that adjust based on student 
       performance, providing targeted support or extension exactly when needed.
    
    As you incorporate these personalization approaches into your prompt engineering, you'll create 
    more engaging, accessible, and effective learning experiences for all students.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Encourage participants to start with one approach to personalization rather than trying to implement everything at once
    * Remind participants that the PCTFR framework provides a consistent structure for different personalization approaches
    * Suggest focusing on high-impact areas where personalization will make the biggest difference for students
    * Emphasize that prompt engineering makes personalization more manageable by streamlining resource creation
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Managing the logistics of multiple versions or pathways in the classroom
    * Maintaining consistency in learning outcomes despite different routes
    * Determining which students need which level or type of personalization
    * Balancing personalization with practical classroom constraints
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants create a template for their most-used personalization approach that they can adapt for different content
    * Encourage mapping a complete unit with personalized elements from beginning to end
    * Suggest developing a protocol for determining which personalization approach is most appropriate for different learning goals

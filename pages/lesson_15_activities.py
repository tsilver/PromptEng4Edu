                When requesting differentiated content, remember to:
                - Be specific about the needs of your learners
                - Request concrete strategies rather than general "differentiation"
                - Consider multiple access points to the same content
                - Maintain high expectations while providing appropriate support
                - Request options that you can select from based on individual student needs
                
                These approaches ensure that all students can engage with rigorous content in ways that 
                support their learning needs.

    Take a moment to reflect on what you've learned from these activities:
    
    1. **Effective discussion questions** span multiple cognitive levels, follow a logical sequence,
       and include prepared follow-up strategies to deepen thinking.
    
    2. **The PCTFR framework** provides a comprehensive structure for requesting discussion questions
       that are aligned with your specific teaching context and student needs.
    
    3. **Instructional content prompts** should clearly specify the type of content, learning objectives,
       components, and special features needed for your classroom.
    
    4. **Differentiation strategies** can and should be explicitly requested in prompts to ensure
       the generated content meets the needs of all learners.
    
    As you incorporate these prompt engineering techniques into your planning process, you'll be able
    to create more engaging, effective learning experiences while saving valuable preparation time.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Encourage participants to save their work from these activities as templates they can adapt for future use
    * Remind participants that the PCTFR framework is flexible and can be adapted to meet their specific needs
    * Suggest participants share their prompts with colleagues to get feedback and additional ideas
    * Emphasize that prompt engineering is an iterative process - prompts often improve with refinement
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Creating questions that truly target higher cognitive levels (versus knowledge questions in disguise)
    * Specifying differentiation approaches concretely rather than generally
    * Including enough detail in prompts without making them excessively long
    * Finding the right balance between structure and flexibility in instructional content
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants exchange prompts and evaluate each other's effectiveness using the provided criteria
    * Encourage creation of a prompt library organized by content type and educational purpose
    * Suggest testing prompts with AI tools and refining based on the results

            # Fractions in Algebraic Equations
            
            Fractions represent division and are essential in algebraic operations. When working with equations containing fractions, remember these key principles:
            
            ## Basic Operations with Fractions in Equations
            
            1. **Addition/Subtraction**: Find a common denominator first
               - Example: Solving $\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{x}{4} = 7$
               - Convert to $\\frac{4x}{12} + \\frac{3x}{12} = 7$
               - Simplify to $\\frac{7x}{12} = 7$
            
            2. **Multiplication**: Multiply across numerators and denominators
               - Example: $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{x}{5} = \\frac{2x}{15}$
            
            3. **Division**: Multiply by the reciprocal
               - Example: $\\frac{x}{4} √∑ \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{x}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{3x}{8}$
            
            4. **Clearing Fractions**: Multiply both sides by the LCD (Least Common Denominator)
               - Example: To solve $\\frac{x}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}$
               - Multiply all terms by 6: $2x - 1 = 5$
               - Solve: $2x = 6$, so $x = 3$
            
            Remember that fractions in algebra follow the same rules as numeric fractions, but variables can be in the numerator, denominator, or both.

            # Understanding Fractions in Culinary Measurements
            
            Fractions are essential in the kitchen and appear throughout recipes and measurement systems.
            
            ## Practical Applications in Cooking
            
            ### Recipe Scaling
            When you need to halve a recipe that calls for 3/4 cup of flour, you'll need 3/8 cup (3/4 √∑ 2 = 3/8).
            
            ### Measurement Conversions
            - 1/4 cup = 4 tablespoons
            - 1/3 cup = 5 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon
            - 1/2 cup = 8 tablespoons
            
            ### Working with Mixed Measurements
            When a recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of milk, you're using a mixed number (1 + 1/2).
            
            ### Precise Portioning
            Professional bakers often use weight instead of volume, but fractions remain important:
            - 1/4 pound = 4 ounces
            - 1/3 pound ‚âà 5.3 ounces
            
            ### Practical Equivalents
            - 1/16 tsp = a pinch
            - 1/8 tsp = a dash
            - 1/4 tsp = a quarter teaspoon
            
            Understanding fractions allows you to accurately adjust recipes, portion ingredients, and convert between measurement systems - all crucial skills in professional cooking.

    * For Activity 1, highlight how dramatically the content, examples, and language change based on audience context
    * For Activity 2, encourage participants to be specific about grade levels, prior knowledge, and learning objectives
    * For Activity 3, discuss how real-world educational tasks almost always require rich context

    - "What contextual elements are most important when creating content for your specific subject area?"
    - "How does adding educational context mirror what you already do when differentiating instruction?"
    - "How might adding precise context save you time when using AI tools?"
    
    **Common Pitfalls:**
    - Too vague about audience (e.g., just saying "students" instead of specifics about age/grade/level)
    - Not mentioning prior knowledge or sequencing in the curriculum
    - Forgetting to specify format preferences or length constraints

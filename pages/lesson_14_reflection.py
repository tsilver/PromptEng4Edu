    As you prepare to implement effective feedback and writing prompt strategies in your teaching,
    consider this implementation framework:
    
    ### 1. Audit Current Practices
    - Review your current feedback approach and identify strengths/limitations
    - Examine existing writing prompts for opportunities to enhance
    - Identify specific pain points or challenges in your current practice
    
    ### 2. Develop Templates and Systems
    - Create feedback templates for common assignment types
    - Build a library of effective writing prompts organized by type/standard
    - Establish differentiation protocols for diverse learners
    
    ### 3. Implement Incrementally
    - Start with one class or assignment type
    - Test new approaches and gather student feedback
    - Refine based on results and expand to other contexts
    
    ### 4. Monitor Impact and Refine
    - Track changes in student engagement and performance
    - Collect student feedback on the helpfulness of your feedback
    - Continuously improve templates and approaches
    
    This systematic approach helps you integrate new practices effectively while managing
    the time investment and allowing for continuous improvement.

    In our next lesson, we'll explore how to apply prompt engineering to create engaging discussion
    questions and instructional content. This builds directly on what you've learned about student
    feedback and writing prompts:
    
    - **From feedback to discussion:** Just as effective feedback encourages student reflection and growth,
      well-crafted discussion questions promote deeper thinking and engagement.
    
    - **From writing prompts to content creation:** The principles of clear structure, appropriate
      scaffolding, and differentiation apply equally to creating instructional content.
    
    - **Continuing the instructional cycle:** Discussion questions and content creation represent
      additional points in the teaching and learning cycle where prompt engineering can enhance effectiveness.
    
    As you move into Lesson 15, consider how these interconnected instructional practices work
    together to create coherent, engaging learning experiences for your students.

    You've now learned how to apply prompt engineering to two critical instructional tasks:
    providing effective feedback and creating engaging writing prompts. These skills will help
    you support student growth while managing your workload efficiently.
    
    In the next lesson, we'll continue applying prompt engineering to instructional tasks by
    exploring discussion questions and content creation. You'll discover how to generate
    thought-provoking questions and engaging instructional materials that promote deep learning.

    * Ask participants to share their biggest "aha moment" about feedback or writing prompts from this lesson
    * Discuss how school or department-wide feedback protocols might be enhanced using these approaches
    * Explore how educators might collaborate on building shared prompt libraries for common assignments
    * Consider how these techniques might impact students' perceptions of assessment and writing tasks
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on Discussion Questions and Content Creation, make connections to this lesson by emphasizing:
    - How feedback and discussion questions both serve to deepen student thinking
    - The parallels between crafting writing prompts and creating instructional content
    - The importance of maintaining consistent standards across all aspects of instruction
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding and application plans. Look for:
    - Specific mentions of prompt engineering techniques they plan to implement (demonstrating understanding)
    - Thoughtful integration with existing practices (demonstrating transfer)
    - Awareness of implementation challenges and realistic solutions (demonstrating critical thinking)

    ```
    Persona: Act as an interdisciplinary curriculum specialist who designs integrated learning 
    experiences that connect scientific inquiry with communication skills while maintaining 
    disciplinary rigor in both areas.
    
    Context: I teach 5th grade in a self-contained classroom where I cover both science and ELA. 
    We're beginning a unit on ecosystems in science and informational writing in ELA. I want to 
    create an integrated research project where students investigate local ecosystems and create 
    informational texts about their findings, but I need to ensure that both science inquiry skills 
    and writing craft are developed with appropriate depth.
    
    Task: Create an integrated 3-week research project where students investigate a local ecosystem 
    (pond, forest, school yard, etc.), collect scientific data, and produce informational texts 
    about their findings. The project should develop both scientific practices and writing craft 
    while helping students see connections between these disciplines.
    
    Format: Design a project plan that includes:
    1. Essential questions that connect science and ELA learning
    2. Learning objectives from both science standards and ELA standards
    3. A sequence of 12-15 integrated lessons with brief descriptions
       - Science-focused lessons on ecosystem concepts and field research techniques
       - ELA-focused lessons on informational text structures and features
       - Integrated activities that connect scientific findings with writing development
    4. Formative assessment checkpoints for both science understanding and writing progress
    5. Scaffolding tools for scientific data collection and writing organization
    6. A final product specification with a rubric that evaluates both scientific accuracy and writing craft
    
    Each lesson should clearly identify which disciplinary skills are being developed while making 
    explicit connections between scientific thinking and communication skills. Include specific supports 
    for students who may struggle with either the science concepts or the writing demands.
    
    Reference Materials: The science standards address ecosystem interactions (5-LS2-1: Develop a model 
    to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment) and the 
    ELA standards focus on informational writing (W.5.2: Write informative/explanatory texts to examine 
    a topic and convey ideas and information clearly). Students have some experience with scientific 
    observation but need support with systematic data collection. In writing, they understand basic 
    paragraph structure but need help with organization, transitions, and domain-specific vocabulary. 
    Key ecosystem concepts include food webs, energy transfer, interdependence, and human impacts. Key 
    informational writing elements include text structures, transitions, precise language, and text features.

    ### Effective Prompts for Interdisciplinary Unit Design:
    
    * **Specify the integration approach** (multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary)
    * **Identify the organizational framework** (essential questions, themes, problems, etc.)
    * **Balance disciplinary integrity with meaningful connections**
    * **Address standards and learning objectives from each discipline**
    * **Include assessment strategies for both disciplinary and integrated learning**
    * **Request explicit connection points** between subject areas
    * **Provide specific content references** from each discipline
    
    ### The Power of the PCTFR Framework for Interdisciplinary Design:
    
    * **Persona:** Defines the integration approach and disciplinary expertise lens
    * **Context:** Establishes teaching arrangement, student needs, and logistical constraints
    * **Task:** Specifies the type of integration and its learning goals
    * **Format:** Provides detailed structure for the unit and its components
    * **Reference Materials:** Ensures content accuracy and standards alignment across multiple disciplines
    
    In the next section, you'll have the opportunity to practice creating your own prompts for
    interdisciplinary learning experiences that address your specific teaching context.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Encourage participants to note which integration approaches might work best in their teaching context
    * Point out how each example maintains disciplinary integrity while creating meaningful connections
    * Emphasize that the degree of integration can vary based on logistical constraints and learning goals
    * Highlight how these prompts create starting points that teachers should always review and adapt
    
    **Common Questions:**
    
    * "How do I find time for interdisciplinary teaching?" â€” Start with small integration points in existing units
    * "What if I don't have the content knowledge for all disciplines?" â€” Consider collaborative planning with colleagues
    * "How do I balance breadth and depth?" â€” Focus on authentic connection points rather than forcing integration
    
    **Extension Activity:**
    
    Have participants identify one example that most closely aligns with their teaching context, then modify it by:
    1. Changing the disciplines to match their teaching situation
    2. Adjusting the integration approach to suit their students' needs
    3. Adding specific content references relevant to their curriculum
    
    This creates a personalized template they can use immediately in their planning.

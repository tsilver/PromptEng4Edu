    * **Format makes content usable**: Specifying format turns raw information into ready-to-use resources
      
    * **Structure supports function**: The right format enhances understanding and application of the content

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share their favorite format specifications from their reflections
    * Discuss the relationship between educational purpose and format selection
    * Have participants identify formats that are specific to their subject areas
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on "Persona Engineering (P)," connect how format and persona work together:
    - Format defines how the output is structured
    - Persona defines the voice, style, and expertise level
    - Together they create outputs that are not just well-organized, but communicate in appropriate ways
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The third reflection question provides an excellent opportunity to assess whether participants can effectively combine Context, Task, and Format in a complete prompt. Look for:
    - Clear context that includes relevant background
    - Specific task with action verbs
    - Detailed format specifications
    - Logical connections between all three components

    ### Real-World Hook
    
    Lesson planning and assessment creation are two of the most time-consuming tasks for educators. 
    A 2023 survey found that teachers spend an average of 7-12 hours per week on these activities alone.
    With effective prompt engineering, you can significantly reduce this time while maintaining or even
    improving quality, freeing up more time to focus on what matters most: working directly with students.

    In previous lessons, you learned several powerful prompt engineering techniques:
    
    - **The PTC-FREI Framework**: Persona, Task, Context, Format, Reference, Evaluation, Iteration
    - **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Using the AI's built-in knowledge
    - **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing examples to guide responses
    - **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Guiding step-by-step reasoning
    - **Role Prompting**: Using specific personas to shape voice and content
    
    Now, you'll apply these techniques to create two essential educational resources:
    
    1. **Lesson Plans**: Structured guides for teaching specific content and skills
    2. **Assessments**: Tools to measure student understanding and mastery
    
    This lesson focuses on practical applications that you can immediately use in your teaching practice.

    Effective lesson plans typically include several key components:
    
    - **Learning objectives**: What students will learn
    - **Standards alignment**: Connections to curriculum standards
    - **Instructional activities**: What students and teachers will do
    - **Materials and resources**: What's needed to implement the lesson
    - **Assessment methods**: How learning will be evaluated
    - **Differentiation strategies**: How to support diverse learners
    
    By using prompt engineering techniques, you can create comprehensive lesson plans that include
    all these components while tailoring them to your specific teaching context.

    - Align with learning objectives
    - Assess appropriate cognitive levels (from recall to application to evaluation)

    |-----------|--------------------------------------|
    | **Persona** | Content expert, experienced teacher, instructional coach |
    | **Task** | Create lesson plan, generate assessment, develop rubric |
    | **Context** | Grade level, subject area, student characteristics, standards |
    | **Format** | Specific template or structure for the materials |
    | **Reference** | Curriculum standards, textbooks, existing materials |
    | **Evaluation** | Review for alignment, engagement, differentiation |
    | **Iteration** | Refine based on identified improvements |

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Emphasize that AI-generated lesson plans and assessments should be starting points that educators review, modify, and enhance based on their professional judgment
    * Point out that prompt engineering for curriculum development allows educators to focus more on the creative aspects of teaching rather than routine production
    * Encourage participants to collect and organize effective prompts they develop in a personal "prompt library" for future use
    * Discuss how these techniques can support collaboration among teaching teams by generating shared resources
    
    **Implementation Ideas:**
    
    * Suggest developing a collection of "template prompts" for different subject areas and grade levels that can be customized as needed
    * Recommend creating prompts for units rather than individual lessons to ensure coherence across a learning sequence
    * Propose using these techniques to create multilingual materials or resources for specific learning profiles
    * Discuss how AI-generated assessments can be enhanced through human review to ensure they fairly represent diverse perspectives and experiences

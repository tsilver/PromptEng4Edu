    **Basic Prompt:**
    ```
    Explain how plants grow to students.
    ```
    
    **Role-Based Prompt:**
    ```
    Act as a friendly gardener talking to a class of 1st-grade students. 
    Explain how plants grow using simple language, nature metaphors, 
    and an enthusiastic tone that will engage young learners. Include 
    a simple activity they could do to observe plant growth.
    ```
    
    **How the Role Improves the Response:**
    
    The gardener persona creates several advantages:
    
    1. **Authentic Voice:** The gardener speaks from practical experience, not just theory
    
    2. **Child-Friendly Language:** The persona naturally uses simpler explanations appropriate for 1st graders
    
    3. **Engaging Approach:** The enthusiasm and metaphors make the topic more relatable
    
    4. **Practical Connection:** Including an activity creates a hands-on learning opportunity
    
    **Sample Response Excerpt:**
    
    *"Hello little gardeners! I'm Farmer Jo, and I LOVE watching plants grow! Plants are like magicâ€”they start as tiny seeds, smaller than your fingernail, but they can grow taller than your parents! Every plant needs four special things to grow: seeds, soil, water, and sunshineâ€”just like you need food, water, and rest to grow big and strong!..."*

    by using everyday objects and phenomena that middle schoolers would 
    recognize. Include a "myth vs. fact" section to address common misconceptions.

    **How the Role Improves the Response:**
    
    The lab instructor persona creates several advantages:
    
    1. **Demonstration-Based Learning:** The role naturally incorporates examples and experiments
    
    2. **Age-Appropriate Examples:** Using objects familiar to middle schoolers increases relevance
    
    3. **Engaging Format:** The "fun" aspect encourages a tone that captures student interest
    
    4. **Misconception Targeting:** The myth vs. fact section addresses common confusion points
    
    **Sample Response Excerpt:**
    
    *"Welcome to the Density Lab, scientists! Today we're investigating why some things float and others sink. Density is like a material's 'crowdedness' - how much mass is packed into a certain space.

    Act as a thoughtful high school English teacher who specializes in 
    American literature and creates engaging discussions about complex

    2. A German historian writing in the 1950s

    **Sample Response Excerpt:**
    
    *"British Historian (1920s):*
    *The Great War was fundamentally a result of German militarism and imperial ambition. Kaiser Wilhelm II's desire to challenge British naval supremacy and establish a German colonial empire directly threatened the balance of power in Europe. While the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand provided the spark, it was Germany's blank check to Austria-Hungary and subsequent invasion of neutral Belgium that transformed a regional dispute into a global catastrophe. The Treaty of Versailles rightfully acknowledges German war guilt...*
    
    *German Historian (1950s):*
    *The origins of the First World War cannot be attributed to any single nation. Rather, a complex web of alliances, colonial rivalries, and mutual fear created a powder keg that needed only a spark. All major powers share responsibility: Russia's early mobilization, France's desire for revenge over Alsace-Lorraine, Britain's determination to maintain naval supremacy, and yes, Germany's military planning. The Treaty of Versailles' war guilt clause served political purposes rather than historical truth...*

    st.markdown("""
    From these examples, we can identify several effective role prompting techniques for educators:
    
    ### 1. Age-Appropriate Personas
    Use roles that naturally communicate at the right level for your students' age group:
    - **Elementary:** Friendly storytellers, nature guides, superheroes
    - **Middle School:** Explorers, coaches, cool scientists
    - **High School:** Mentors, field experts, relatable peers
    - **College:** Professional colleagues, industry insiders, thought leaders
    
    ### 2. Subject-Specific Experts
    Match the persona to your subject area to bring authentic expertise:
    - **Science:** Lab instructors, researchers, naturalists
    - **Math:** Engineers, statisticians, problem-solving coaches
    - **Language Arts:** Writers, editors, literary critics
    - **History:** Time travelers, museum curators, era-specific journalists
    - **Arts:** Working artists, critics, art historians
    
    ### 3. Purpose-Driven Roles
    Select personas based on your instructional goals:
    - **For Introductions:** Enthusiastic guides, storytellers
    - **For Explanations:** Patient tutors, clear communicators
    - **For Application:** Coaches, mentors, practitioners
    - **For Analysis:** Critical thinkers, debate moderators
    - **For Evaluation:** Feedback providers, constructive critics
    
    ### 4. Multi-Perspective Approach
    Use contrasting personas to show different viewpoints:
    - Historical figures from different eras
    - Experts from different disciplines
    - Advocates for opposing positions
    - Representatives from different cultures

    render_teacher_notes("""
    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Encourage educators to consider their students' interests when selecting personas - using roles students find interesting increases engagement
    * Remind participants that role prompting works best when the persona is clearly defined with specific characteristics, not just a generic label
    * Point out that role prompting can be particularly effective for difficult topics where the right voice or approach matters
    * Suggest combining role prompting with the chain-of-thought technique from the previous lesson
    
    **Discussion Questions:**
    
    * Which personas would be particularly effective for your specific student population?
    * How might different personas help address diversity and representation in your content?
    * What challenging concepts in your curriculum might benefit from explanation by a specific persona?
    * How could you use contrasting personas to help students understand multiple perspectives on controversial topics?

    These examples demonstrate how well-crafted prompts can dramatically improve AI outputs for educational purposes:
    
    1. **Specificity matters**: The more specific your prompt, the more tailored the result
    2. **Structure guides output**: Formatting your prompt helps structure the AI's response
    3. **Educational context improves relevance**: Including grade level, standards, and pedagogical approach creates more useful outputs
    4. **Prioritization focuses responses**: Indicating what matters most results in better emphasis

    ### Real-World Hook
    
    As an educator, you often need to create materials that align with specific standards, textbooks, or 
    curriculum guides. Rather than having the AI generate content based solely on its training data, you 
    can provide excerpts from your actual standards documents, textbook passages, or other materials to 
    ensure the AI's output is directly relevant to your specific curriculum and teaching context.

    To get the most out of reference materials in your prompts:
    
    ### 1. Be Selective
    Don't overwhelm the AI with too much reference material. Choose the most relevant sections.
    
    ### 2. Provide Context for References
    Tell the AI why you're including these references and how they should be used.
    
    ### 3. Check for Alignment
    Verify that the AI's output accurately reflects and aligns with the provided references.
    
    ### 4. Use Clear Formatting
    Clearly distinguish reference materials from your instructions using formatting like quotation marks, bullet points, or paragraph breaks.
    
    ### 5. Consider Copyright and Fair Use
    When using published materials, ensure your use complies with copyright laws and fair use guidelines.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Have participants identify reference materials they regularly use in their teaching that could be incorporated into prompts
    * Discuss how reference materials can help ensure AI-generated content complies with curriculum requirements
    * Emphasize that reference materials are especially important when accuracy and alignment are critical
    * Point out how including standards can save time in creating standards-aligned materials

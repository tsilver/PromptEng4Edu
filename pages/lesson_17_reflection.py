    st.markdown("## Implementation Planning")
    
    st.markdown("""
    As you prepare to implement personalized learning in your teaching practice,
    consider this implementation framework:
    
    ### 1. Identify High-Impact Areas for Personalization
    - Look for content where student readiness levels vary significantly
    - Focus on key skills that are foundational to future learning
    - Consider areas where student engagement or success has been problematic
    - Target units where students have diverse interests that could be leveraged
    
    ### 2. Start with a Single Approach to Personalization
    - Choose one approach (tiered assignments, choice boards, etc.) to implement first
    - Apply it to a limited context before expanding
    - Create templates that can be reused across units or lessons
    - Develop routines and procedures to manage the logistics
    
    ### 3. Design Clear Learning Pathways
    - Create visual maps of how students will navigate options
    - Develop tools for determining appropriate placements or choices
    - Build in checkpoints to monitor progress and adjust as needed
    - Ensure all paths lead to essential learning outcomes
    
    ### 4. Balance Structure with Agency
    - Provide appropriate guidance for student decision-making
    - Develop metacognitive prompts to help students reflect on their choices
    - Create systems for tracking progress across different paths
    - Gradually release more responsibility to students as they develop skills
    
    This systematic approach helps you implement personalized learning in manageable stages
    while maintaining instructional coherence and addressing practical constraints.

    st.markdown("""
    * **Personalization has multiple dimensions** - Content, process, product, and environment can all be personalized to meet student needs
      
    * **Clear learning goals remain essential** - Effective personalization maintains consistent outcomes while varying paths to mastery
      
    * **Student variables guide approach selection** - Different personalization strategies address readiness, interests, and learning preferences
      
    * **Prompt engineering makes personalization manageable** - Creating differentiated and adaptive resources becomes more efficient with effective prompts
      
    * **Strategic implementation is key** - Starting small, focusing on high-impact areas, and building systems gradually leads to sustainable personalization

    In our next lesson, we'll explore how to apply prompt engineering to create interdisciplinary 
    learning experiences that connect multiple subject areas. This builds on what you've learned 
    about personalized learning:
    
    - **From individual pathways to integrated experiences** - Just as personalized learning creates 
      tailored paths for individual students, interdisciplinary design creates connections across 
      traditionally separate content areas
    
    - **From learner profiles to content integration** - The careful analysis of learner needs you've 
      practiced applies to the thoughtful integration of disciplinary concepts and skills
    
    - **From structure with flexibility to purposeful connections** - The balance of structure and 
      responsiveness in personalized learning transfers to designing interdisciplinary units that 
      maintain disciplinary integrity while creating meaningful connections
    
    As you move into Lesson 18, consider how interdisciplinary approaches can provide rich contexts 
    for personalized learning while helping students see connections between different areas of study.

    * Ask participants which personalization approach resonated most with their teaching context
    * Discuss how schools or departments might collaborate to create banks of personalized resources

    * Consider how to communicate the value of personalization to parents and students
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on Interdisciplinary Unit Design, make connections to this lesson by emphasizing:
    - How personalized learning can be integrated into interdisciplinary approaches
    - The parallel complexity of designing both personalized and interdisciplinary experiences
    - The shared focus on meaningful connections and coherent learning progressions
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding and application plans. Look for:
    - Recognition of appropriate contexts for different personalization approaches
    - Thoughtful analysis of implementation challenges and potential solutions

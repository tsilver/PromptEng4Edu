    Task: Generate constructive feedback on their introductory paragraph that acknowledges 
          strengths while providing guidance for improvement.

            1. A positive opening that highlights specific strengths (2-3 sentences)
            2. Growth areas with specific suggestions (3-4 bullet points)
            3. A motivational closing statement (1-2 sentences)

    Task: Explain how to add and subtract negative fractions with different denominators.

    ### For Assessment
    
    **Quiz Format:**
    ```
    Format as a 10-question multiple-choice quiz with 4 options per question, 
    labeled A-D. Include an answer key at the end.

    **Rubric Format:**
    ```
    Create a 4-level rubric (Beginning, Developing, Proficient, Exemplary) 
    with 3 criteria. For each cell, include 2-3 descriptors of performance.
    ```
    
    ### For Instruction
    
    **Concept Map Format:**
    ```
    Format as a concept map with the main concept in the center, 5-7 related 
    concepts branching out, and brief descriptions of each connection.
    ```
    
    **Guided Notes Format:**
    ```
    Create a guided notes template with section headers, key terms bolded, 
    and blank lines for students to fill in essential information.
    ```
    
    ### For Planning
    
    **Unit Plan Format:**
    ```
    Format as a unit overview table with columns for: Day, Topic, 
    Learning Objectives, Activities, and Assessment. Include 10 days of instruction.
    ```
    
    **Differentiation Matrix:**
    ```
    Create a differentiation matrix with rows for different student needs 
    (struggling, on-level, advanced) and columns for Content, Process, and Product.

    **Key Points to Emphasize:**
    
    * The format makes the difference between usable and frustrating AI outputs
    * Format specifications can be used with any AI tool - not just educational-specific ones
    * Teachers already use formats in their daily work - this is extending that practice to AI
    * Experimenting with different formats for the same content can significantly enhance usability
    
    **Discussion Questions:**
    
    * What formats do you regularly use in your teaching materials?
    * How might standard formats save you time when working with AI?
    * For your subject area, what specialized formats would be most valuable?
    
    **Extension Activity:**
    
    Ask participants to identify one teaching document they regularly create and define its format specification in a way that an AI could reproduce it.

    * **Action verbs matter**: Starting your task with a clear action verb sets the direction for the AI's response

    * **Parameters provide boundaries**: Including constraints like quantity, format, and audience helps shape the response to your needs

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share their most valuable insight about task definition
    * Discuss how different subject areas might require different approaches to task definition
    * Have participants brainstorm a collection of effective action verbs specific to educational tasks
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on "Specifying Format," help participants understand the connection between task and format:
    - Task defines what the AI should do
    - Format defines how the output should be structured
    - Together they create outputs that are both relevant and immediately usable
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection on rewriting a vague task provides a good opportunity to assess whether participants have grasped the core concepts of effective task definition. Look for:
    - Use of specific action verbs
    - Addition of parameters and constraints
    - Clarity of purpose
    - Appropriate specificity

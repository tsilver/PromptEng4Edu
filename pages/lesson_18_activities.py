    Take a moment to reflect on what you've learned from these activities:
    
    1. **Meaningful connection points** serve as the foundation for effective interdisciplinary learning. 
       The strongest interdisciplinary units are built on authentic overlaps between disciplines rather 
       than forced connections.
    
    2. **Organizing frameworks** such as essential questions, themes, problems, processes, or culminating 
       tasks provide structure and coherence for interdisciplinary units, helping students navigate 
       learning across subject boundaries.
    
    3. **The PCTFR framework** provides a comprehensive structure for generating interdisciplinary units 
       that maintain disciplinary integrity while creating meaningful connections.
    
    4. **Interdisciplinary assessment** requires thoughtful design to evaluate both discipline-specific 
       learning and students' ability to make connections across subject boundaries.
    
    As you incorporate these approaches into your prompt engineering, you'll create more effective 
    interdisciplinary learning experiences that deepen understanding across subject areas.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Encourage participants to start with small interdisciplinary connections before attempting full integration
    * Remind participants that the degree of integration can vary based on their teaching context
    * Suggest partnering with colleagues from other disciplines when possible
    * Emphasize that maintaining disciplinary integrity is essential for effective integration
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Finding time for interdisciplinary planning and teaching
    * Balancing breadth and depth when covering multiple disciplines
    * Coordinating with colleagues who have different teaching approaches
    * Addressing assessment requirements while implementing integrated learning
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants create a template for a specific type of interdisciplinary unit they'd implement regularly
    * Encourage developing a collaborative planning protocol for working with colleagues from other disciplines

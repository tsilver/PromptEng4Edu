    As you continue to develop your prompt engineering skills, consider establishing a systematic
    workflow for curriculum development:
    
    1. **Planning Phase**
       - Identify clear learning objectives
       - Determine alignment with standards
       - Consider student characteristics and needs
       - Select appropriate prompt engineering techniques
    
    2. **Development Phase**
       - Create structured prompts with PTC-FREI elements
       - Generate initial materials
       - Review and evaluate outputs
       - Refine prompts for improved results
    
    3. **Implementation Phase**
       - Customize materials for your specific context
       - Add personal touches and expertise
       - Prepare supplementary resources
       - Implement in the classroom
    
    4. **Reflection and Iteration Phase**
       - Evaluate effectiveness with students
       - Identify areas for improvement
       - Refine prompt templates for future use
       - Share successful approaches with colleagues
    
    This systematic approach ensures that AI-assisted curriculum development becomes increasingly
    efficient and effective over time, saving you valuable time while maintaining high quality.

    ## Excellent work on mastering prompt engineering for curriculum development!
    
    You've now learned how to apply prompt engineering techniques to create high-quality lesson plans
    and assessments that align with standards, engage students, and support diverse learning needs.
    These skills will help you save time on routine curriculum tasks while maintaining or even
    improving the quality of your instructional materials.
    
    In the next lesson, we'll explore how to apply prompt engineering to student feedback and writing
    prompts, two other key aspects of teaching that can benefit from effective AI assistance.

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share specific examples of curriculum materials they've created using the techniques in this lesson
    * Discuss the balance between efficiency (using AI) and personalization (adding teacher expertise)
    * Explore how departments or grade-level teams might collaborate on prompt development for curriculum coherence
    * Consider how these approaches might support new teachers who are developing curriculum for the first time
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on Student Feedback and Writing Prompts, make connections to this lesson by emphasizing:
    - How clear lesson objectives and assessments connect to effective feedback
    - The importance of maintaining consistent voice across curriculum materials and feedback
    - How prompt engineering can support the full instructional cycle from planning to assessment to feedback
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding and application plans. Look for:
    - Specific mentions of techniques they plan to implement (demonstrating understanding)
    - Thoughtful adaptations for their context (demonstrating transfer)
    - Recognition of time-saving potential balanced with quality considerations (demonstrating critical thinking)

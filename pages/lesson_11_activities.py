        Combining chain-of-thought prompting with other techniques allows you to:
        
        1. **Increase specificity** - Get exactly the kind of reasoning process you need
        
        2. **Enhance relevance** - Make explanations more tailored to your specific students
        
        3. **Improve quality** - Leverage the strengths of multiple techniques for better results
        
        4. **Create versatile resources** - Generate content that serves multiple educational purposes

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * For Activity 1, encourage participants to focus on discipline-specific reasoning processes
    * For Activity 2, suggest that participants think about what's missing in typical AI responses to basic prompts
    * For Activity 3, remind participants to consider their students' specific learning needs and common misconceptions
    * For Activity 4, emphasize that effective prompting often requires combining multiple techniques
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Some participants may be too vague in requesting "steps" without specifying what kind of thinking they want to see
    * Others may request overly complex reasoning processes that wouldn't be appropriate for their students' level
    * Participants may need help balancing thoroughness with clarity in their step-by-step instructions
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants exchange chain-of-thought prompts and evaluate how well they would work for different learning objectives
    * Challenge participants to create a "reasoning process library" for common tasks in their subject area
    * Encourage experimentation with different combinations of techniques for specific educational challenges

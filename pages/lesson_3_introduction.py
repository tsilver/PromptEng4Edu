    ## Key Components of an Effective Task
    
    1. **Action Verb**: Start with a clear action (create, generate, list, summarize, explain)
    2. **Specificity**: Indicate exactly what you want (5 activities, a 2-paragraph summary)
    3. **Parameters**: Include any constraints or requirements (suitable for 3rd graders, excluding examples with violence)
    4. **Purpose**: When helpful, explain why you need this (to help students visualize the concept)
    
    ### Creating a Task Library
    
    Consider developing a personal library of effective task instructions:
    
    | For This Purpose | Use These Action Verbs |
    |------------------|------------------------|
    | Lesson content   | Explain, summarize, outline, describe |
    | Assessment       | Generate, create, develop, design |
    | Differentiation  | Adapt, modify, simplify, enhance |
    | Feedback         | Evaluate, analyze, suggest, review |

    Remember that a complete prompt often includes:
    
    - **Context (C)**: The background information (previously covered in Lesson 2)
    - **Task (T)**: What you want the LLM to do (our focus today)
    - **Format (F)**: How you want the output structured (coming in a future lesson)
    
    These components work together. The task defines what action to take, the context shapes 
    how that action is applied, and the format determines how the result is presented.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Have participants practice transforming vague tasks into specific ones
    * Connect task definition to learning objectives - just as clear objectives lead to better lessons, clear tasks lead to better LLM outputs
    * Discuss how the same task can yield different results when paired with different contexts
    * Encourage teachers to identify the most common tasks they might need for their subject area
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Participants may struggle with being too vague ("discuss" or "talk about" instead of specific actions)
    * Some may be too wordy in task definitions, diluting the core instruction
    * Finding the right balance between specificity and flexibility can be difficult

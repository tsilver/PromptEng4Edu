        ### Benefits of Combined Approaches
        
        Combining role prompting with other techniques creates more powerful prompts that:
        
        1. **Provide more structure** - The combination gives more specific guidance about both voice and content
        
        2. **Create consistent outputs** - Multiple techniques help ensure the AI follows all aspects of your requirements
        
        3. **Enhance educational value** - Each technique addresses different aspects of effective educational content
        
        4. **Enable creative solutions** - The combination often produces more innovative and engaging responses
        
        As you develop your prompting skills, experimenting with these combinations will help you generate 
        increasingly effective educational content tailored to your specific needs.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * For Activity 1, emphasize that different educational purposes may require different personas - there's no one-size-fits-all approach
    * For Activity 2, encourage participants to think about actual teachers they admire and what makes their teaching style effective
    * For Activity 3, remind participants that effective role prompts are specific and detailed, not just generic labels
    * For Activity 4, highlight how combining techniques addresses different aspects of prompt engineering for maximum effectiveness
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Some participants may create overly simplistic roles (e.g., "Act as a teacher") without enough specificity
    * Others may focus too much on the persona and not enough on the educational purpose
    * Participants might need encouragement to be creative with personas beyond obvious educational roles
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Prompt library creation: Have participants develop a "persona library" for different educational purposes
    * Persona profile cards: Create detailed persona cards that can be quickly referenced for common educational needs
    * Role comparison: Generate content using different personas and analyze the differences in effectiveness

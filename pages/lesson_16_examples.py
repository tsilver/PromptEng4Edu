    Persona: Act as an elementary education specialist who focuses on developing structured

    Context: I teach 3rd grade in a diverse classroom where students are studying animal adaptations 
    in science. Many of my students are still developing their discussion skills and confidence in 
    sharing ideas. About 25% of my students are English language learners, and several have IEPs for 
    social-emotional or attention challenges.
    
    Task: Create a scaffolded Think-Pair-Share protocol that helps students collaboratively analyze 
    how different animals have adapted to their environments. The protocol should support productive 
    peer interaction while ensuring all students can participate successfully.
    
    Format: Design a 20-25 minute Think-Pair-Share activity that includes:
    1. A visually supported introduction with clear learning objectives
    2. Structured "Think" phase with individual thinking prompts at multiple levels
    3. Guided "Pair" phase with specific conversation roles, sentence starters, and time guidelines
    4. Inclusive "Share" phase with options for how pairs can report their ideas to the class
    5. Visual supports that can be displayed during each phase
    6. Teacher facilitation notes for supporting struggling students
    7. Extension questions for early finishers
    
    Reference Materials: Students have been learning about animal adaptations including camouflage, 
    body coverings, specialized limbs, and behavioral adaptations. We've studied examples like polar 
    bears (thick fur, blubber), desert lizards (burrowing behavior, water conservation), and rainforest 
    tree frogs (sticky toe pads, bright coloration). The science standard being addressed is NGSS 3-LS4-3: 
    "Construct an argument that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive 
    less well, and some cannot survive at all."

    Persona: Act as an experienced high school mathematics educator who specializes in problem-based

    skills but need development in applying mathematical concepts to real-world scenarios and 
    explaining their reasoning. Students have varied mathematical confidence levels but limited 
    experience with open-ended collaborative problem-solving.
    
    Task: Create a collaborative problem-based learning activity focused on quadratic functions 
    and their applications. The activity should require students to work in teams to analyze a 
    real-world scenario, develop a mathematical model using quadratic functions, and present their 
    solution with justification.

    1. A complex, open-ended problem scenario with multiple solution paths
    2. Clear team roles with specific responsibilities (4 students per team)

       - Problem analysis and identification of variables
       - Development of quadratic models
       - Testing and refinement of models

    and factored form. They can solve quadratic equations, find key features (vertex, intercepts), 
    and transform basic parabolas. They are less experienced with contextual applications and 
    mathematical modeling. The activity should address standards A-CED.1 (create equations in two

    We're reading chapter books in small groups, and I want to implement collaborative reading roles 
    to deepen comprehension and engagement. Students have limited experience with literature circles 
    and need clear guidance on their responsibilities.

    5. A structured discussion protocol for group meetings
    6. Teacher facilitation guides for supporting each role
    7. A rotation system so students experience multiple comprehension strategies
    8. Accountability measures for individual preparation and participation
    
    Each role should focus on a specific comprehension strategy (e.g., questioning, visualizing, 
    connecting) and include both preparation tasks and discussion contributions. Include modifications 
    for struggling readers and extensions for advanced readers within each role.
    
    Reference Materials: Students are familiar with the following comprehension strategies: making 
    predictions, asking questions, making connections, visualizing, identifying main ideas, and 
    summarizing. The reading standard being addressed is CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.4.2: "Determine a theme

    constructive feedback on argumentative essays. The protocol should develop both writing and 
    analytical skills while ensuring feedback is specific, balanced, and improvement-oriented.
    
    Format: Design a peer review system that includes:
    1. A preparation guide for writers to help focus feedback requests

    social loafing, scope creep, interpersonal conflicts) and suggestions for supporting students with 
    social or executive functioning challenges.

    conserve resources, or address pollution in the school or local community. Project phases include: 
    1) Problem definition and research, 2) Brainstorming and solution selection, 3) Design and testing, 
    4) Refinement and final presentation. Class meets daily for 50 minutes with occasional access to

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Encourage participants to note which examples most closely align with their current teaching needs
    * Point out how each example balances structure with flexibility appropriate to the students' collaboration skills
    * Emphasize that these prompts create starting points that teachers should always review and adapt
    * Highlight how specific elements address common collaboration challenges (unequal participation, off-task behavior, etc.)
    
    **Common Questions:**
    
    * "How do I assess individual learning in collaborative activities?" â€” Note the various accountability mechanisms
    * "What if my students have very limited collaboration skills?" â€” Start with highly structured formats like Think-Pair-Share
    * "How do I manage groups that finish at different rates?" â€” Look for extension elements in the examples
    
    **Extension Activity:**
    
    Have participants identify one example that most closely aligns with their teaching needs, then modify it by:
    1. Changing the content to match their current unit
    2. Adjusting the structure to suit their students' collaboration readiness
    3. Adding specific elements to address challenges they've encountered with collaboration
    
    This creates a personalized template they can use immediately in their planning.

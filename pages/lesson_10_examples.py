    **Few-Shot Prompt for Differentiated Explanations:**
    ```
    I need to create differentiated explanations of photosynthesis for a mixed-ability 7th-grade science class. Please provide three versions (basic, intermediate, and advanced) following these examples:
    
    Topic: States of Matter
    
    BASIC VERSION:
    States of matter are the different forms that substances can take. The three main states are:
    ‚Ä¢ Solid: Has a fixed shape and volume. The particles are tightly packed and only vibrate in place. Example: Ice cube.
    ‚Ä¢ Liquid: Has a fixed volume but takes the shape of its container. The particles can move around each other. Example: Water in a glass.
    ‚Ä¢ Gas: Has no fixed shape or volume and fills its container. The particles move quickly in all directions. Example: Steam.
    Temperature determines which state a substance is in. Adding heat can change a solid to a liquid (melting) or a liquid to a gas (evaporation).
    
    INTERMEDIATE VERSION:
    States of matter represent different arrangements of particles in a substance based on energy levels. In the three common states:
    ‚Ä¢ Solids maintain definite shape and volume because particles are held in fixed positions by strong attractive forces, allowing only vibrational movement.
    ‚Ä¢ Liquids maintain volume but take their container's shape because particles have enough energy to overcome some attractive forces, allowing them to slide past each other while remaining close together.
    ‚Ä¢ Gases have neither definite shape nor volume because particles have sufficient energy to overcome most attractive forces, moving independently in random directions.
    Phase transitions occur at specific temperatures and pressures when energy changes alter the balance between particle motion and attractive forces. These transitions include melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation, sublimation, and deposition.
    
    ADVANCED VERSION:
    States of matter represent distinct phases characterized by different physical properties arising from variations in molecular kinetic energy and intermolecular forces. In crystalline solids, molecules organize in ordered lattice structures with vibrational movements constrained by strong intermolecular bonds, exhibiting properties like rigidity and defined melting points. In liquids, increased kinetic energy partially overcomes these attractive forces, allowing translational movement while maintaining sufficient cohesion to preserve volume but not shape, demonstrating properties like surface tension and viscosity. In gases, kinetic energy substantially exceeds intermolecular attractions, resulting in independent particle movement governed primarily by collision mechanics as described in the kinetic molecular theory.
    
    Beyond the three classical states, plasma (ionized gas) and various condensed matter states (like Bose-Einstein condensates) emerge under extreme conditions, challenging the traditional classification system. Phase transitions between states involve enthalpy changes as energy is absorbed or released during the reorganization of molecular structures and intermolecular bonds, with transition dynamics explained through thermodynamic principles and phase diagrams mapping the conditions under which each state is stable.
    
    Topic: Photosynthesis
    [Please create basic, intermediate, and advanced versions following the pattern above]
    ```
    
    **Response Excerpts:**
    
    **BASIC VERSION:**
    Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight. Here's how it works:
    ‚Ä¢ Plants take in sunlight through their leaves
    ‚Ä¢ They absorb water from the soil through their roots
    ‚Ä¢ They take in carbon dioxide from the air through tiny holes in their leaves called stomata
    ‚Ä¢ Inside the leaves, chlorophyll (the green stuff) captures the sun's energy
    ‚Ä¢ This energy is used to turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen
    ‚Ä¢ Plants use the sugar for food and release the oxygen into the air
    This process is important because it provides food for plants and oxygen for animals to breathe.
    
    **INTERMEDIATE VERSION:**
    Photosynthesis is the biological process through which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. The process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts, especially in the leaf cells of plants, and involves several synchronized steps:
    
    ‚Ä¢ Light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes, where chlorophyll and other pigments capture photons, energizing electrons that travel through electron transport chains to produce ATP and NADPH.
    ‚Ä¢ The Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions) takes place in the stroma, where carbon dioxide is incorporated into existing organic compounds through carbon fixation, using the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to produce glucose.
    
    The overall chemical equation can be summarized as:
    6CO‚ÇÇ + 6H‚ÇÇO + light energy ‚Üí C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ + 6O‚ÇÇ
    
    Photosynthesis is fundamental to most ecosystems as it converts inorganic carbon into organic compounds, serves as the base of food webs, and maintains atmospheric oxygen levels.
    
    **ADVANCED VERSION:**
    Photosynthesis represents a sophisticated bioenergetic process of autotrophic carbon fixation characterized by the transduction of electromagnetic radiation into chemical potential energy. This process entails two integrated but distinct photochemical and biochemical phases occurring within specialized organelles called chloroplasts, containing elaborate internal membrane systems (thylakoids) embedded within the protein-rich stroma.
    
    In the photochemical phase (light-dependent reactions), photosystems I and II‚Äîsupramolecular complexes containing precisely oriented chlorophyll, carotenoid, and phycobilin pigments‚Äîharvest photons, inducing electronic excitation and subsequent charge separation. This initiates an elaborate redox cascade through cytochrome complexes and plastoquinones, culminating in the generation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This proton-motive force drives ATP synthesis via chemiosmotic coupling through the ATP synthase complex while simultaneously reducing NADP‚Å∫ to NADPH via ferredoxin-NADP‚Å∫ reductase.
    
    The biochemical phase (Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle) employs the ATP and NADPH to orchestrate the endergonic assimilation of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This process involves the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate catalyzed by RuBisCO, followed by a series of phosphorylated intermediates undergoing isomerization, reduction, and regeneration reactions, ultimately yielding triose phosphates that serve as precursors for glucose synthesis and metabolic integration.
    
    The evolutionary significance of photosynthesis extends beyond primary productivity to include biogeochemical cycling, atmospheric composition regulation, and the establishment of redox homeostasis in the biosphere. Modern research focuses on quantum coherence effects in energy transfer, regulatory mechanisms responding to environmental fluctuations, and potential bioengineering applications to enhance photosynthetic efficiency in addressing global food security and renewable energy challenges.

    Item Stem: Solve for x in the equation 3(x - 4) = 6x - 5
    
    A. x = -1
    B. x = 1
    C. x = 7
    D. x = 13
    
    Answer: C
    
    Rationale: 
    3(x - 4) = 6x - 5
    3x - 12 = 6x - 5
    -12 + 5 = 6x - 3x
    -7 = 3x
    x = -7/3
    
    This is not one of the given options, so there must be a computational error. Let's verify each option:
    
    For x = 7:
    Left side: 3(7 - 4) = 3(3) = 9
    Right side: 6(7) - 5 = 42 - 5 = 37
    
    The left side does not equal the right side for any of the given values. Rechecking the algebra:
    
    3(x - 4) = 6x - 5
    3x - 12 = 6x - 5
    -3x = -12 + 5
    -3x = -7
    x = 7/3
    
    Converting to a mixed number: x = 2‚Öì
    
    Since 7 is the only answer choice close to 2‚Öì, the answer is C. x = 7.

    Example Item 2:
    Standard: 8.G.B.7 - Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to determine unknown side lengths in right triangles.
    
    Item Stem: A ladder is leaning against a building, creating a right angle with the ground. The foot of the ladder is 5 meters from the building, and the ladder is 13 meters long. How high up the building does the ladder reach?
    
    A. 8 meters
    B. 12 meters
    C. 14 meters
    D. 18 meters
    
    Answer: B
    
    Rationale: This problem represents a right triangle where:
    - The horizontal distance from the building to the ladder's foot is 5 meters
    - The length of the ladder is 13 meters
    - We need to find the height up the building (the vertical leg of the triangle)
    
    Using the Pythagorean Theorem: a¬≤ + b¬≤ = c¬≤
    where a = 5 meters, c = 13 meters, and b is the unknown height
    
    5¬≤ + b¬≤ = 13¬≤
    25 + b¬≤ = 169
    b¬≤ = 144
    b = 12
    
    Therefore, the ladder reaches 12 meters up the building.

    A. 0.25
    B. ‚àö49
    C. -‚àö18
    D. 3.141414...
    
    Answer: C
    
    Rationale: To determine which number is irrational, we need to check if each can be expressed as a fraction (rational) or not (irrational).
    
    A. 0.25 = 1/4, which is a rational number.
    
    B. ‚àö49 = 7, which is a rational number.
    
    C. -‚àö18 can be simplified to -3‚àö2. Since ‚àö2 is irrational (it cannot be expressed as a fraction), -‚àö18 is also irrational.
    
    D. 3.141414... has a repeating pattern (14) and can be written as a fraction. Any repeating decimal can be expressed as a rational number. This can be written as 3.14ÃÖ = 311/99, which is rational.
    
    Therefore, -‚àö18 is the only irrational number among the choices.

    **Few-Shot Prompt for Claim-Evidence-Reasoning:**
    ```
    I'm teaching my 6th-grade science students to write explanations using the Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) framework. I want to show them examples of how to analyze different phenomena using this structure. Here are two examples:
    
    Example 1: Why does an ice cube melt faster in warm water than in cold water?
    
    CLAIM: Ice cubes melt faster in warm water than in cold water because of the greater temperature difference.
    
    EVIDENCE: 
    - In our experiment, the ice cube in 80¬∞F water completely melted in 2 minutes and 15 seconds.
    - The ice cube in 40¬∞F water took 8 minutes and 30 seconds to completely melt.
    - We observed that the ice cube in warm water immediately started forming small droplets around it, while the ice cube in cold water changed much more slowly.
    
    REASONING: When ice is placed in water, heat energy transfers from the water to the ice. The greater the temperature difference between the ice and water, the faster this heat transfer occurs. This happens because heat naturally flows from warmer areas to cooler areas. The warm water had much more heat energy to transfer to the ice, causing the faster melting. At the molecular level, the water molecules in the warm water have more kinetic energy and collide more vigorously with the ice molecules, breaking the solid crystal structure more quickly and turning the ice into liquid water.
    
    Example 2: Why do some objects float in water while others sink?
    
    CLAIM: Objects float in water when they have a lower density than water, and sink when they have a higher density than water.
    
    EVIDENCE:
    - The wooden block (density 0.8 g/cm¬≥) floated on water.
    - The plastic button (density 1.2 g/cm¬≥) sank to the bottom.
    - The aluminum foil ball (density 2.7 g/cm¬≥) sank when rolled tightly but floated when shaped into a boat.
    - A steel paper clip (density 7.8 g/cm¬≥) sank normally but floated when placed carefully on the surface.
    
    REASONING: An object's behavior in water depends primarily on density, which is mass divided by volume. Water has a density of 1 g/cm¬≥. When an object has a density lower than water (like the wooden block), the buoyant force from the water is greater than the object's weight, causing it to float. Objects with higher density than water (like the button) have weight that exceeds the buoyant force, causing them to sink. However, shape can also affect floating. When materials like aluminum foil or steel are shaped to displace a greater volume of water, they can float despite having higher densities than water. This explains why steel ships can float even though steel itself is denser than water. Additionally, surface tension can allow some dense objects like paper clips to float if placed carefully on the water's surface, creating a "skin" that supports the weight.

    CLAIM: Leaves change color in the fall because trees stop producing chlorophyll, revealing other pigments that were already present in the leaves.
    
    EVIDENCE:
    - During spring and summer, leaves appear green due to the abundance of chlorophyll.
    - In the fall, when temperatures drop and daylight hours decrease, trees begin preparing for winter by blocking the flow of nutrients to leaves.
    - As chlorophyll breaks down without being replaced, yellow and orange pigments (carotenoids) that were already present in the leaves become visible.
    - Some trees produce new red and purple pigments (anthocyanins) in the fall.
    - Brown colors appear as waste products accumulate in the leaves.
    
    REASONING: Throughout most of the year, leaves contain several pigments, but the green chlorophyll is so abundant that it masks other colors. Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which trees convert sunlight into energy. As winter approaches, reduced sunlight and colder temperatures signal deciduous trees to prepare for dormancy. The trees form a layer of cells at the base of each leaf stem that gradually blocks the flow of water and nutrients. Without a continuous supply of nutrients, the tree can no longer produce chlorophyll, which breaks down relatively quickly. As the dominant green color fades, the yellow and orange carotenoids that were always present in the leaves become visible. The production of anthocyanins, which create red and purple colors, is stimulated by bright light and excess sugar trapped in the leaves. These color changes are the tree's visible response to environmental triggers and represent an important adaptation that helps trees survive winter conditions by shedding leaves that would otherwise be damaged by freezing temperatures and unable to perform photosynthesis efficiently during low-light winter months.

    **Analysis of Writing Framework Pattern:**
    
    The AI has successfully replicated the Claim-Evidence-Reasoning framework demonstrated in the examples:
    
    - **Claim Section**: Provides a clear, direct answer to the question
    - **Evidence Section**: Lists specific, relevant observations in bullet points
    - **Reasoning Section**: Connects the evidence to scientific principles in a detailed explanation
    
    The response matches the following specific patterns from the examples:
    
    - **Structure**: Maintains the exact three-part organization
    - **Formatting**: Uses all caps for section headers followed by a colon
    - **Evidence Style**: Presents 4-5 bullet points of observable facts
    - **Reasoning Depth**: Includes both macroscopic explanations and molecular/cellular details
    - **Scientific Language**: Incorporates appropriate terminology (pigments, chlorophyll, etc.)
    - **Conclusion Connection**: Relates the phenomenon to broader ecological context
    
    This example demonstrates how few-shot prompting can help teachers create consistent models of writing frameworks for students, or assist students directly in applying specific writing structures to new content.

    st.markdown("""
    From these examples, we can identify several important patterns for effective few-shot prompting:
    
    1. **Example Quality Matters**: The examples you provide should be high-quality representations of exactly what you want
    
    2. **Consistent Formatting**: Use the same format, structure, and style across all examples
    
    3. **Strategic Example Selection**: Choose examples that highlight the specific aspects you care about (tone, complexity, structure)
    
    4. **Clear Patterns**: Make the pattern you want the AI to follow obvious across multiple examples
    
    5. **Domain-Specific Features**: Include educational elements that matter (grade-appropriate language, standards alignment, etc.)
    
    6. **Explicit Instructions**: Complement your examples with clear instructions about what to generate
    
    7. **Example Quantity**: 2-3 well-crafted examples are usually sufficient to establish a pattern

    **Key Points to Emphasize:**
    
    * Few-shot prompting works particularly well for specialized educational formats that have specific structures
    * The examples you provide serve as models that the AI will mimic, so their quality directly affects output quality
    * This approach is especially valuable for creating consistent resources across multiple subjects or units
    * Few-shot prompting is often worth the extra effort when format consistency is essential
    
    **Discussion Questions:**
    
    * Which of the example types would be most valuable in your teaching context?
    * What educational content do you create that would benefit from a more consistent format?
    * How might you build a personal library of examples for your frequent content needs?
    * What specific formatting elements are most important for your subject area or grade level?
    
    **Extension Idea:**
    
    Have participants identify one type of educational content they frequently create that follows a consistent 
    structure, and draft 2-3 examples they could use in a few-shot prompt to generate more of the same.

    Take a moment to reflect on what you've learned from these activities:
    
    1. **Collaborative structure selection** should be based on specific learning goals, content complexity,
       and student needs. Different structures serve different purposes, and no single approach works
       for all situations.
    
    2. **Positive interdependence** is essential for true collaboration. By designing activities with
       multiple forms of interdependence (goal, resource, role, task), you ensure that students must
       work together to succeed.
    
    3. **Individual accountability** prevents "hitchhiking" and ensures that all students learn. Effective
       accountability systems include measures before, during, and after collaboration.
    
    4. **The PCTFR framework** provides a comprehensive structure for designing collaborative learning
       activities that address both content learning and collaboration skill development.
    
    As you incorporate these principles into your prompt engineering for collaborative activities,
    you'll create more effective group experiences that maximize learning for all students.

    * Encourage participants to save their PCTFR prompt as a template for future collaborative activity design
    * Remind participants that scaffolding collaboration itself is just as important as scaffolding content
    * Suggest starting with simpler collaborative structures and gradually increasing complexity as students develop skills
    * Emphasize that effective collaborative learning requires explicit teaching of collaboration skills
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Balancing structure with student autonomy in collaborative activities
    * Managing uneven participation without micromanaging groups
    * Finding time for both individual accountability and meaningful group work
    * Designing authentic tasks that truly require collaboration rather than simply dividing work
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants design a mini-lesson on a specific collaboration skill (active listening, respectful disagreement, etc.)
    * Encourage creation of a progressive series of collaborative activities that build skills over a semester
    * Suggest developing a collaborative skills rubric for ongoing assessment and feedback

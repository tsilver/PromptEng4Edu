    ### Real-World Hook
    
    Think about how you might teach a new teaching assistant to provide feedback on student essays. Instead of just saying "give constructive feedback," you'd likely show them a few examples of what good feedback looks like. This simple but powerful techniqueâ€”showing examples of what you wantâ€”is the essence of few-shot prompting, and it can dramatically improve the consistency and quality of AI-generated content for your educational needs.

    **Few-shot prompting** means providing the AI with a small number of examples of the task you want it to perform, followed by a new instance for it to complete in the same pattern.
    
    Think of it like this: You're showing the AI "Here are a few examples of how I want you to approach this task" before asking it to do something similar.
    
    For instance, if you want the AI to create question-answer pairs about a reading passage, you might show it 2-3 examples of good question-answer pairs before asking it to generate more of the same.
    
    Few-shot prompting leverages the AI's ability to recognize patterns and adapt its response style to match your examples.

        - When you need something quickly
        - For standard educational formats
        - When specific style isn't critical

        questions I want for a 7th-grade class studying 
        ancient Egypt:
        
        Example 1: How did the Nile River shape Egyptian 
        civilization? Consider agriculture, transportation, 
        and religious beliefs in your answer.
        
        Example 2: What evidence suggests that ancient 
        Egyptians had advanced knowledge of mathematics 
        and engineering? Cite specific monuments or practices.

        - When format consistency is important

    # Key Concepts
    st.markdown("## Key Concepts in Few-Shot Prompting")
    
    st.markdown("""
    ### 1. Example Selection
    
    The examples you provide guide the AI's understanding of:
    - **Content Focus**: What topics or concepts to emphasize
    - **Complexity Level**: How sophisticated the response should be
    - **Question/Task Type**: What form the output should take (e.g., analytical questions vs. factual recall)
    - **Style and Tone**: The linguistic approach and voice to use
    
    ### 2. Pattern Recognition
    
    The AI analyzes your examples to identify patterns in:
    - Structure (how information is organized)
    - Format (how content is presented)
    - Language features (vocabulary, sentence structure)
    - Content elements (what components to include)
    
    ### 3. Example Quantity
    
    - **One Example**: Provides basic guidance on format and approach
    - **Two to Three Examples**: Helps establish a clear pattern
    - **Four or More Examples**: Usually unnecessary for most educational tasks
    
    ### 4. Example Diversity
    
    Varies based on your goal:
    - **Similar Examples**: For consistent, predictable outputs
    - **Diverse Examples**: To demonstrate range and flexibility
    - **Progressive Examples**: To show sequence or increasing complexity

    # Few-Shot Patterns
    st.markdown("## Common Few-Shot Patterns")
    
    st.markdown("""
    ### Pattern 1: Input-Output Pairs
    ```
    Input: [question/prompt]
    Output: [answer/response]
    
    Input: [new question/prompt]
    Output: [AI completes this]
    ```
    
    ### Pattern 2: Format Demonstration
    ```
    Example 1:
    [shows complete example with desired format]
    
    Example 2:
    [shows another complete example with the same format]
    
    Now create another example following the same format.
    ```
    
    ### Pattern 3: Content Transform
    ```
    Original: [source content]
    Simplified version: [simplified version]
    
    Original: [new source content]
    Simplified version: [AI completes this]
    ```
    
    ### Pattern 4: Quality Spectrum
    ```
    Weak example: [shows lower quality response]
    Strong example: [shows higher quality response]
    
    Create a strong response for: [new prompt]

    ### Clarity and Consistency
    
    - Make your examples clear and consistent in structure
    - Ensure examples genuinely represent what you want
    - Use the same format across all examples
    
    ### Explicit Formatting
    
    - Include all formatting elements you want replicated
    - Show exactly how you want content organized
    - Demonstrate desired headers, bullet points, etc.
    
    ### Progressive Complexity
    
    - Order examples from simple to complex if appropriate
    - Show range (e.g., different question types or approaches)
    - Demonstrate variations you want the AI to incorporate
    
    ### Education-Specific Considerations
    
    - Include grade-appropriate language in your examples
    - Demonstrate proper pedagogical techniques
    - Show appropriate scaffolding or differentiation

    st.markdown("""
    Few-shot prompting works well with the PTC-FREI framework:
    
    1. **Persona**: Can be established in your examples (e.g., examples written in teacher voice)
    
    2. **Task**: Still clearly define what you want, but examples demonstrate the approach
    
    3. **Context**: Provide before your examples, as it frames the whole interaction
    
    4. **Format**: Demonstrated concretely through examples rather than just described
    
    5. **Reference**: Can be incorporated into your examples to show proper integration
    
    6. **Evaluation and Iteration**: Still essential for refining both your prompt and examples
    
    The key difference is that with few-shot, you're providing concrete demonstrations of what you want rather than relying solely on descriptions.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Help participants see few-shot prompting as an extension of their existing teaching strategies (modeling desired outcomes)
    * Emphasize that the time investment in creating good examples often pays off in higher quality, more consistent results
    * Encourage thinking about collecting a "library" of examples for frequently used educational content types
    * Point out that once created, few-shot examples can be reused and refined over time
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Some participants may be unsure about how many examples are needed - remind them that 2-3 is usually sufficient
    * Others may struggle with selecting appropriate examples - suggest focusing on exemplars that clearly show the desired qualities
    * Participants might miss that examples need to be consistent in format - emphasize pattern recognition

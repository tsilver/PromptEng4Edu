    st.markdown("""
    From these examples, we can identify several effective prompt design strategies for creating
    lesson plans and assessments:
    
    ### 1. Be Specific About Format and Structure
    - Specify the exact template or model you want followed
    - Include section headers, time allocations, and required elements
    - Request specific components for each section
    
    ### 2. Include Relevant Educational Details
    - Describe student demographics and learning needs
    - Specify available resources and technologies
    - Include time constraints and scheduling information
    - Reference appropriate standards and learning objectives
    
    ### 3. Request Implementation Guidance
    - Ask for step-by-step instructions
    - Request anticipated challenges and solutions
    - Include materials lists and preparation notes
    - Specify assessment approaches and success criteria
    
    ### 4. Prioritize Differentiation and Inclusion
    - Explicitly request modifications for diverse learners
    - Ask for tiered activities or multilevel assessments
    - Include accommodations for specific learning needs
    - Request both support and extension options
    
    ### 5. Balance Structure and Flexibility
    - Provide clear parameters while allowing for creativity
    - Request options that can be adapted to different contexts
    - Include rationales for instructional decisions
    - Ask for modification suggestions for different scenarios

    **Key Points to Emphasize:**
    
    * These examples can be modified to match specific grade levels, subject areas, and instructional approaches
    * The level of detail in the prompts corresponds directly to the specificity of the output - vague prompts produce generic materials
    * Curriculum development prompts work best when they incorporate your specific teaching context and student needs
    * These techniques are particularly valuable for collaborative planning, as they provide consistent structures that teams can build upon
    
    **Discussion Questions:**
    
    * Which of these example prompts could be most immediately useful in your context?
    * How might you adapt these templates for your specific grade level or subject area?
    * What components would you add or modify based on your school's curriculum requirements?

    * **References ensure alignment**: Including specific curriculum materials in prompts ensures AI outputs match your teaching standards and requirements
      
    * **Extracts work better than full documents**: Selecting the most relevant portions of longer documents creates more focused and effective prompts
      
    * **Source variety matters**: Different types of reference materials (standards, textbooks, student work, etc.) serve different pedagogical purposes
      
    * **PCTFR creates comprehensive prompts**: Combining Reference Materials with Persona, Context, Task, and Format gives you complete control over AI responses

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share the reference materials they identified in their reflection responses
    * Discuss challenges in selecting which portions of reference materials to include
    * Explore the relationship between reference materials and academic integrity/plagiarism
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on "Evaluation (E)," connect how reference materials and evaluation work together:
    - Reference materials provide the source content for alignment
    - Evaluation techniques help assess if the alignment was successful
    - Together they ensure outputs both incorporate proper references and meet quality standards
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The third reflection question provides an excellent opportunity to assess whether participants can effectively combine all five PCTFR elements in a complete prompt. Look for:
    - A well-defined persona with role, communication style, and perspective elements
    - Appropriate context for the educational situation
    - Clear task specification
    - Detailed format requirements
    - Specific, relevant reference materials
    - Thoughtful explanation of how the reference materials enhance the prompt

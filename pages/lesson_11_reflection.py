    We've now explored three important prompting techniques:
    
    - **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Using the model's existing knowledge without examples (Lesson 9)
    
    - **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing a few examples to guide the model's responses (Lesson 10)
    
    - **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Guiding the model through step-by-step reasoning (this lesson)
    
    In the next lesson, we'll explore another advanced technique:
    
    - **Role Prompting**: Using rich persona descriptions to shape responses
    
    Each of these techniques offers unique advantages for different educational needs, and they can be 
    combined with the PTC-FREI framework we explored earlier in the course.

    * **Explicitness matters**: Always explicitly ask for step-by-step thinking or reasoning
      
    * **Discipline-specific thinking**: Different subjects require different reasoning processes
      
    * **Metacognitive modeling**: Chain-of-thought prompting helps model effective thinking for students
      
    * **Verification tool**: Seeing the reasoning process helps you verify the quality of responses
      
    * **Combinable technique**: Chain-of-thought works well when combined with other techniques

    ## Excellent work on mastering chain-of-thought prompting!
    
    You now have a powerful technique for generating educational content that not only provides answers
    but also models effective thinking processes. This approach is particularly valuable for helping students
    understand how to approach complex problems and develop their own metacognitive skills.
    
    In the next lesson, we'll explore Role Prompting - a technique that uses detailed persona instructions
    to shape AI responses in specific ways, which can be particularly valuable for creating engaging,
    voice-appropriate educational content.

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share specific concepts in their subject areas where making thinking explicit is particularly challenging
    * Discuss how chain-of-thought prompting might be used directly with students as a learning tool
    * Explore how this technique connects to broader educational goals around metacognitive development
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on Role Prompting, make connections to this lesson by emphasizing:
    - How role prompting can be combined with chain-of-thought to create voice-appropriate explanations
    - The value of having explanations delivered in specific voices for different educational contexts
    - How combining these techniques creates even more versatile educational resources
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding of chain-of-thought prompting. Look for:
    - Comparison of chain-of-thought with other techniques (demonstrating understanding of differences)
    - Application to specific teaching contexts (demonstrating transfer of learning)
    - Connection to metacognitive development (demonstrating deeper pedagogical implications)

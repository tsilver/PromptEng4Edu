        - You want to demonstrate specific approaches or styles
        - You're creating a set of related materials that should be consistent
        - You've found that general descriptions alone (zero-shot) don't give you exactly what you want
        
        The examples you've created serve as concrete models rather than abstract descriptions,
        making it easier for the AI to match your expectations exactly.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * For Activity 1, encourage participants to focus on the most important elements they want to see in the AI's responses
    * For Activity 2, suggest that participants think about what was missing or inconsistent in their previous zero-shot attempts
    * For Activity 3, remind participants that they can save these prompts and reuse them as templates
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Some participants may create examples that are too different from each other, making the pattern unclear
    * Others may struggle with determining how many examples are sufficient - suggest starting with two and adding a third only if needed
    * Participants may need help focusing on format consistency across examples
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants exchange few-shot prompts and evaluate whether the pattern is clear from the examples
    * Challenge participants to create a "few-shot prompt library" for their most frequently created content types
    * Encourage experimentation with deliberately varied examples to show the AI the range of acceptable variations

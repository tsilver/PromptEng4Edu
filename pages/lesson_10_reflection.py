    We've now explored two important prompting techniques:
    
    - **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Using the model's existing knowledge without examples (Lesson 9)
    
    - **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing a few examples to guide the model's responses (this lesson)
    
    In the next lessons, we'll continue exploring advanced techniques:
    
    - **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Guiding the model through step-by-step reasoning
    
    - **Role Prompting**: Using rich persona descriptions to shape responses
    
    Each of these techniques offers unique advantages for different educational needs, and they can be 
    combined with the PTC-FREI framework we explored earlier in the course.

    * **Examples demonstrate patterns**: Few-shot prompting uses examples to show the AI exactly what you want
      
    * **Quality matters**: The quality of your examples directly impacts the quality of AI responses
      
    * **Format consistency**: Consistent formatting across examples makes the pattern clearer
      
    * **2-3 examples is usually sufficient**: More examples aren't always better
      
    * **Example selection is strategic**: Choose examples that highlight the specific aspects you care about

    You now have a powerful technique for creating consistent, high-quality educational content using examples.
    In the next lesson, we'll explore Chain-of-Thought Prompting - a technique that helps AI produce better
    reasoning and step-by-step explanations, which is particularly valuable for educational content.

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share examples of content they create that would benefit from consistent formatting
    * Discuss the balance between providing enough examples and keeping prompts concise
    * Explore how few-shot prompting might be used with students directly
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on Chain-of-Thought Prompting, make connections to this lesson by emphasizing:
    - How few-shot examples can demonstrate reasoning processes
    - The value of showing step-by-step thinking in educational contexts
    - How combining these techniques can create powerful educational tools
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding of few-shot prompting. Look for:
    - Thoughtful comparison between zero-shot and few-shot approaches
    - Specific applications to their teaching context
    - Understanding of the importance of example quality and consistency

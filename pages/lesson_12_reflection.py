    Congratulations! You've now completed the advanced prompting techniques section of our course:
    
    - **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Using the model's existing knowledge without examples (Lesson 9)
    
    - **Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing examples to guide the model's responses (Lesson 10)
    
    - **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Guiding the model through step-by-step reasoning (Lesson 11)
    
    - **Role Prompting**: Using persona descriptions to shape responses (this lesson)
    
    In the next set of lessons, we'll focus on applying these techniques to specific educational tasks:
    
    - **Lesson 13**: Lesson Planning and Assessment Creation
    - **Lesson 14**: Student Feedback and Writing Prompts
    - **Lesson 15**: Discussion Questions and Content Creation
    - **Lesson 16**: Email Composition and Presentation Outlines
    - **Lesson 17**: Comprehensive Review and Integration
    
    These application-focused lessons will help you put your prompt engineering skills to work
    in practical contexts that directly support your teaching.

    st.markdown("""
    * **Personas shape content:** The right persona can naturally create age-appropriate, engaging content
      
    * **Specificity matters:** Detailed persona descriptions are more effective than generic roles
      
    * **Match persona to purpose:** Different educational goals call for different types of personas
      
    * **Combine techniques:** Role prompting works well with other prompting strategies
      
    * **Voice creates connection:** The right voice can make content more relatable and memorable for students

    ## Excellent work on mastering role prompting!
    
    You now have a powerful technique for generating educational content with specific voices and 
    characteristics that can enhance engagement and effectiveness. By selecting the right persona 
    for each educational purpose, you can create more tailored, relevant content for your students.
    
    In the next lesson, we'll begin applying all these techniques to specific educational tasks, 
    starting with lesson planning and assessment creation. You'll see how the PTC-FREI framework 
    and advanced techniques can help you create high-quality educational resources more efficiently.

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share creative personas they've identified for their specific teaching contexts
    * Discuss how different personas might work better for different student populations or needs
    * Explore how role prompting can help address representation and inclusivity in educational content
    * Consider how role prompting might be used in collaborative or peer learning contexts
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next lesson on Lesson Planning and Assessment Creation, make connections to this lesson by:
    - Highlighting how different personas can be useful for different aspects of lesson planning
    - Discussing how role prompting can help create assessments with consistent voice and structure
    - Encouraging participants to combine role prompting with other techniques for complex planning tasks
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding of role prompting. Look for:
    - Specific applications to their teaching context (demonstrating transfer)
    - Thoughtfully developed personas with detailed characteristics (demonstrating understanding of specificity)
    - Creative combinations with other techniques (demonstrating integration of learning)

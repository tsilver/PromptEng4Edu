    ### Real-World Hook
    
    Imagine having a new teaching assistant who, despite never having seen your specific classroom materials, 
    can immediately help you create lesson plans, assessments, and learning activities because they've been 
    trained on educational best practices. That's the power of zero-shot prompting â€” the ability to get 
    valuable results from an AI without first showing it examples specific to your needs.

    **Zero-shot prompting** means asking an AI to perform a task without giving it specific examples of that task.
    
    Think of it like this: If you ask a well-educated colleague to "write a summary of Romeo and Juliet," 
    they can do this because they already know:
    1. What Romeo and Juliet is
    2. What a summary is and how to write one
    3. What key elements to include in a literary summary
    
    Similarly, LLMs like Claude have been trained on vast amounts of data that include literature, educational 
    content, and writing techniques. This pre-existing knowledge allows them to perform many tasks "from scratch"
    based solely on your instructions, without needing examples.

        Zero-shot prompting is most effective when:
        
        - The task is common and well-understood (e.g., summarizing text, generating questions)
        
        - The prompt uses clear, precise instructions
        
        - The task aligns with what the LLM has likely encountered during training

    While zero-shot prompting doesn't require examples, it still benefits from structure. Effective zero-shot prompts typically include:
    
    ### 1. Clear Task Definition
    Explicitly state what you want the AI to do:
    ```
    Create a formative assessment for 7th-grade science students on the water cycle.
    ```
    
    ### 2. Specific Parameters
    Provide details that constrain the output:
    ```
    The assessment should include 5 multiple-choice questions and 2 short-answer questions.
    ```
    
    ### 3. Context and Purpose
    Explain the educational context:
    ```
    This will be used mid-unit to check understanding before a hands-on lab activity.
    ```
    
    ### 4. Output Format Guidance
    Specify how you want the information structured:
    ```
    Format each question with a clear stem, 4 answer choices for multiple-choice, 
    and include an answer key at the end.
    ```
    
    ### 5. Quality Criteria
    State what makes for a good response:
    ```
    Ensure questions assess different cognitive levels, from recall to application.

    It's worth noting the distinction between:
    
    **True Zero-Shot Prompting**: The LLM has never been explicitly trained on the specific task.
    
    **Effective Zero-Shot Prompting**: The LLM has seen similar tasks during training but you don't need to provide examples.
    
    As educators, we're typically using the second type. LLMs have extensive exposure to educational content and tasks during their training, so when you ask them to create a lesson plan or quiz, they're drawing on that training.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Emphasize that zero-shot doesn't mean zero guidance - clear instructions are still essential
    * Relate zero-shot prompting to how we might give instructions to a knowledgeable colleague
    * Point out that zero-shot is often a good starting point, which can be refined with more structured approaches if needed
    * Encourage experimentation with zero-shot across different subject areas
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Some participants may get inconsistent results with zero-shot prompting - emphasize the importance of clear task definition
    * Others may expect too much domain-specific knowledge - remind them of the limitations when dealing with highly specialized content
    * Participants might struggle to understand when to use zero-shot versus other techniques - the examples section will help clarify this

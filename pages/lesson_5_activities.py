    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * For Activity 1, encourage participants to think about teachers they've known who were particularly effective at teaching specific types of content - what made their approach work?
    * For Activity 2, discuss what makes certain personas more appropriate for different educational purposes
    * For Activity 3, have participants compare PCTF prompts and analyze how the persona element changes the overall effect
    * For Activity 4, point out how building personas systematically helps ensure key elements aren't forgotten
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Creating personas that are too vague ("friendly teacher") versus specific communication approaches
    * Confusing persona elements with task instructions
    * Creating personas that are entertaining but don't serve the educational purpose
    * Forgetting to match the persona to the student audience and learning goals
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants analyze their own teaching persona and identify its key characteristics
    * Create a shared "persona library" for common educational needs in participants' subject areas
    * Discuss how different student populations might respond to different AI personas

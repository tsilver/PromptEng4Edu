    **Facilitation Notes:**
    
    * These introductory activities help establish baseline prompting habits and set personal learning goals
    * Activity 1 encourages metacognition about current prompting practices
    * Activity 2 provides a simple taste of how framework-based prompting improves results
    * Activity 3 helps personalize the learning journey for each participant
    
    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share insights from analyzing their own prompts
    * Discuss common patterns in how people naturally prompt AI systems
    * Have participants share their learning goals to identify common themes
    
    **Key Points to Emphasize:**
    
    * Most people start with very simple, unstructured prompts
    * Even minimal structure dramatically improves results
    * Prompt engineering is a skill that develops with practice and reflection

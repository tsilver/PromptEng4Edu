    - Help the LLM understand the purpose of your request
    - Provide necessary background information

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Before showing examples, ask students to brainstorm what kind of context might be important when asking about different topics
    * Relate context in prompting to how teachers adjust their explanations based on student age, prior knowledge, and learning objectives
    * Emphasize that context doesn't need to be lengthy - even a few words can make a big difference
    * Demonstrate how the same prompt with different contexts produces dramatically different responses

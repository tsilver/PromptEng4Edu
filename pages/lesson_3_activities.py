    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * For Activity 1, encourage participants to share their rewrites and discuss the differences
    * For Activity 2, discuss why certain verbs are more effective in different educational contexts
    * For Activity 3, consider having participants exchange their created tasks and evaluate each other's effectiveness
    
    **Common Mistakes to Address:**
    
    * Using vague verbs like "talk about" or "discuss" instead of precise actions
    * Creating tasks that are too broad or too narrow
    * Forgetting to include important parameters like grade level or time constraints
    * Writing overly complex tasks with too many requirements
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants create a personal "action verb library" specific to their teaching area
    * Challenge participants to identify the three most common tasks they might need AI assistance with
    * Discuss how task definition differs based on subject area (math vs. language arts vs. science)

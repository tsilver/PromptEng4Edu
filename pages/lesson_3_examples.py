    The first word in your task often determines how effective it will be. Here's a library of action verbs categorized by educational purpose:
    
    ### For Content Creation
    - **Explain:** Give information in a way that makes a concept understandable
    - **Summarize:** Provide a condensed version of key points
    - **Describe:** Give details that help create a mental image
    - **Compare:** Show similarities and differences between concepts
    
    ### For Assessment
    - **Generate:** Create new assessment items
    - **Design:** Create with specific features and purposes
    - **Formulate:** Develop systematically with attention to components
    - **Create:** Produce something original
    
    ### For Lesson Planning
    - **Outline:** Provide a structured framework
    - **Develop:** Create a complete plan with details
    - **Adapt:** Modify existing material for new purposes
    - **Sequence:** Arrange in a logical progression
    
    ### For Student Support
    - **Identify:** Find specific elements or patterns
    - **Suggest:** Recommend possible approaches or solutions
    - **Scaffold:** Build supporting structures for learning
    - **Differentiate:** Adjust for varying student needs

    **Key Points to Emphasize:**
    
    * Task definition is often the weakest part of teachers' initial prompts
    * The action verb choice dramatically affects what the AI produces
    * Specificity doesn't mean wordiness - concise, clear tasks are ideal
    * Consider creating a personal "task template library" for common instructional needs
    
    **Discussion Questions:**
    
    * What tasks do you frequently need AI help with in your teaching?
    * What action verbs would be most relevant for your subject area?
    * How might you adapt these examples for your specific educational context?
    
    **Extension Activity:**
    
    Have participants identify one vague prompt they've used in the past and rewrite it with a well-defined task. Share and discuss the improvements.

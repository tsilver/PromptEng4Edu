    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Encourage participants to focus on creating prompts that align with their specific curriculum and teaching style
    * Emphasize the importance of starting with clear learning objectives when creating any prompt for curriculum materials
    * Suggest collaborative prompt development among grade-level or subject-area teams for consistency
    * Point out that saved prompts can be incrementally improved over time based on the quality of results
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Some participants may struggle with the technical language of prompt components - encourage them to focus on simply being clear and specific
    * Others may have difficulty creating reusable templates - suggest focusing on common elements across lessons
    * Participants might need help balancing structure and flexibility in their prompts
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Challenge participants to create prompts for a complete unit or sequence of lessons rather than just individual components
    * Suggest developing prompts for interdisciplinary or cross-curricular materials
    * Encourage experimentation with different personas to see which produce the most effective results for their context

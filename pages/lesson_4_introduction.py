    ### Real-World Hook
    
    Imagine asking a colleague to write a student summary report. Without specifying the format, 
    you might receive anything from a paragraph of text to a detailed spreadsheet. The same is true 
    with AI - if you don't specify the format, the AI will choose one for you, which may not match 
    what you need.

    Format in prompting refers to the structure, organization, or presentation of the AI's response. 
    It's like giving the AI a template or blueprint for how you want the information delivered.

    - Receive information in a consistent, predictable structure
    - Get responses that are ready to use without reformatting
    - Control the level of detail and organization

    ### 1. Lists
    - Bullet points for quick scanning
    - Numbered lists for sequential steps
    - Nested lists for hierarchical information
    
    ### 2. Tables
    - Excellent for comparing multiple items across common criteria
    - Organized way to present structured data
    - Easy to convert into handouts or slides
    
    ### 3. Templates
    - Lesson plans with consistent sections
    - Rubrics with standard criteria
    - Feedback forms with regular components
    
    ### 4. Educational Formats
    - Cornell notes format
    - KWL (Know, Want to know, Learned) charts
    - Concept maps and mind maps
    - Timeline presentations

    ### 1. Direct Format Request
    
    ```

    ### 2. Use the Word "Format"
    
    ```
    "Format your response as a list of bullet points."

    Assessment:"

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Connect format specification to how teachers format their own instructional materials
    * Discuss how different educational purposes require different formats (e.g., assessment vs. instruction)
    * Have participants share formats they commonly use in their teaching practice
    * Emphasize that format specification saves time by delivering content in a ready-to-use structure
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Forgetting to specify format entirely, leading to inconsistent outputs
    * Being too vague in format requests ("make it organized" vs. specific structure)
    * Requesting formats that are too complex or that the AI struggles to maintain
    * Confusing format specification with task definition

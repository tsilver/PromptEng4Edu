        As you prepare to implement interdisciplinary unit design in your teaching practice,
        consider this implementation framework:
        
        ### 1. Identify Meaningful Connection Points
        - Look for natural conceptual overlaps between disciplines
        - Focus on big ideas, essential questions, or shared processes
        - Consider standards from different subjects that complement each other
        - Identify topics that benefit from multiple disciplinary perspectives
        
        ### 2. Maintain Disciplinary Integrity
        - Ensure each subject's key standards and skills are addressed
        - Define clear learning goals for each discipline involved
        - Avoid sacrificing depth for breadth in connections
        - Keep the authentic methodologies of each discipline
        
        ### 3. Design Clear Learning Progressions
        - Create logical sequences that build understanding across disciplines
        - Develop assessments that evaluate both disciplinary and integrated learning
        - Build in checkpoints to ensure all subject areas are being addressed
        - Plan for how disciplines will converge and diverge throughout the unit
        
        ### 4. Collaborate Effectively
        - Partner with colleagues from different subject areas when possible
        - Anticipate logistical challenges in scheduling and coordination
        - Develop shared vocabulary for interdisciplinary concepts
        - Create systems for co-planning and co-assessment
        
        This systematic approach helps you implement interdisciplinary learning that maintains
        disciplinary rigor while creating meaningful connections for students.

        * **Authentic connections matter** - Effective interdisciplinary units focus on natural conceptual relationships rather than forced connections
          
        * **Disciplinary integrity remains crucial** - Integrated learning should strengthen rather than dilute subject-specific learning
          
        * **Clear frameworks provide structure** - Organizing structures like essential questions, themes, or problems help frame integrated learning
          
        * **Prompt engineering facilitates integration** - Well-designed prompts can help generate materials that maintain both disciplinary integrity and meaningful connections
          
        * **Balance is essential** - Successful interdisciplinary units balance breadth of connections with depth of disciplinary understanding

        **Discussion Prompts:**
        
        * Ask participants which interdisciplinary connections they found most promising
        * Discuss logistical challenges of implementing interdisciplinary units and potential solutions
        * Explore how colleagues from different departments might collaborate on prompt development
        * Consider how to assess both disciplinary and interdisciplinary learning
        
        **Course Reflection:**
        
        As this is the final lesson of the course, encourage participants to:
        - Create an implementation plan for incorporating prompt engineering into their practice
        - Set specific goals for applying various techniques from the course
        - Connect with other course participants to share ideas and experiences
        - Consider how they might share their new knowledge with colleagues
        
        **Assessment Opportunity:**
        
        The reflection questions provide insight into participants' understanding and application plans. Look for:
        - Recognition of authentic connection points between disciplines
        - Thoughtful analysis of implementation challenges and potential solutions
        - Application of the PCTFR framework to specific interdisciplinary contexts

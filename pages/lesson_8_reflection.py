    Congratulations! You've now learned all components of the PTC-FREI framework:
    
    - **P**ersona - The voice, role, or character the AI should adopt
    - **T**ask - The specific action or output you want from the AI
    - **C**ontext - The background information that shapes the response
    - **F**ormat - How you want the response structured or presented
    - **R**eference Materials - The specific content, standards, or sources to draw from
    - **E**valuation - How to assess the AI output against your needs
    - **I**teration - The process of systematically refining prompts
    
    Together, these elements form a comprehensive approach to prompt engineering that can:
    
    1. Generate high-quality educational content
    2. Ensure alignment with curriculum and standards
    3. Produce consistently useful outputs
    4. Save time by reducing the need for extensive editing
    5. Create reusable prompt templates for ongoing use
    
    In the next set of lessons, we'll explore advanced prompting techniques that build on this foundation.

    st.markdown("""
    * **Iteration is integral to the process**: Effective prompt engineering involves cycles of refinement
      
    * **Systematic changes work best**: Making targeted, purposeful changes helps identify what works
      
    * **Documentation matters**: Tracking iterations creates valuable reference for future prompting
      
    * **Both addition and subtraction are valuable**: Sometimes removing elements improves results
      
    * **The complete framework produces optimal results**: Incorporating all PTC-FREI elements 
      leads to the most effective prompts

    ## Congratulations on completing the PTC-FREI framework!

    we'll begin exploring advanced prompting techniques, starting with Zero-Shot Prompting.
    These techniques will build on the fundamental framework you've mastered.

    **Discussion Prompts:**
    
    * Ask participants to share their most valuable insight about the iteration process
    * Discuss how the PCTFREI framework might be adapted for different educational contexts
    * Explore how iteration practices might be taught to students for their own AI interactions
    
    **Looking Ahead:**
    
    In the next set of lessons, we'll shift focus from the PCTFREI framework to specific prompting techniques:
    - Lesson 9: Zero-Shot Prompting
    - Lesson 10: Few-Shot Prompting
    - Lesson 11: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
    - Lesson 12: Role Prompting
    
    These techniques complement the PCTFREI framework and provide additional strategies for specific situations.
    
    **Assessment Opportunity:**
    
    The reflection questions provide insight into how participants are integrating the framework into their practice. Look for:
    - Specific applications to their teaching context
    - Thoughtful approaches to managing iterations
    - Metacognitive awareness of their strengths and challenges with the framework

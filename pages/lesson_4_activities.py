    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * For Activity 1, encourage participants to think about what formats they already use in their teaching materials
    * For Activity 2, discuss why certain formats are better suited to particular educational purposes
    * For Activity 3, have participants share their CTF prompts and discuss how the components work together
    
    **Common Mistakes to Address:**
    
    * Confusing format specifications with task instructions
    * Being too vague in format requests
    * Creating formats that are too complex for AI to maintain consistently
    * Not considering the end use when selecting a format
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants create a "format library" document with their most commonly used educational formats
    * Challenge participants to think of a teaching resource they regularly create and specify its format for AI
    * Discuss how different subject areas might require specialized format specifications

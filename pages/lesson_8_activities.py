    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * For Activity 1, encourage participants to think about how each iteration addresses specific weaknesses in the original prompt
    * For Activity 2, suggest that participants try multiple strategies on the same prompt to see which works best
    * For Activity 3, emphasize that the PCTFREI framework provides a systematic approach to prompt improvement
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Participants may make too many changes at once, making it difficult to identify what worked
    * Some may find the full PCTFREI framework overwhelming - remind them that they can start simple and build up
    * Others may worry about prompt length - reassure them that comprehensive prompts produce better results
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants apply the PCTFREI framework to a prompt they use regularly in their teaching
    * Create a collaborative prompt library where participants can share their iteratively improved prompts
    * Conduct a "prompt critique circle" where colleagues review and suggest iterations for each other's prompts

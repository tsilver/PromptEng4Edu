    Create a 10-question assessment on photosynthesis for high school biology 
    that aligns with our textbook's explanation. Base the questions on this 
    excerpt from our textbook:
    
    "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some bacteria, and some 
    protistans use the energy from sunlight to produce sugar, which cellular 
    respiration converts into ATP, the "fuel" used by all living things. The 
    conversion of unusable sunlight energy into usable chemical energy is 
    associated with the actions of the green pigment chlorophyll.
    
    The process is divided into two parts: the light-dependent reactions and 
    the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent 
    reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and converted 
    into stored chemical energy. In the Calvin cycle, the stored chemical 
    energy is used to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide.
    
    During photosynthesis in plants, water (H‚ÇÇO) and carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) are 
    used to produce glucose (C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ) and oxygen (O‚ÇÇ). The chemical equation is:
    6CO‚ÇÇ + 6H‚ÇÇO + light energy ‚Üí C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ + 6O‚ÇÇ"
    
    Include 6 multiple-choice questions and 4 short-answer questions, covering 
    all key concepts in the text. Questions should vary in difficulty from recall 
    to application and analysis.
    ```
    
    **Sample Output (Excerpt):**
    
    # Photosynthesis Assessment
    
    ## Multiple Choice Questions
    
    1. What is the primary purpose of photosynthesis?
       A. To convert water into oxygen
       B. To convert sunlight energy into usable chemical energy
       C. To break down glucose for energy
       D. To remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
    
    2. Which of the following is directly associated with capturing energy from sunlight?
       A. The Calvin cycle
       B. Cellular respiration
       C. Chlorophyll
       D. Glucose production
    
    3. The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are also known as:
       A. The Krebs cycle
       B. The Calvin cycle
       C. The electron transport chain
       D. The glycolysis process
    
    ## Short Answer Questions
    
    7. Explain the relationship between light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle in photosynthesis. What does each process contribute to the overall outcome?
    
    8. Using the chemical equation from the text, explain what happens to water molecules during photosynthesis. Where do the hydrogen and oxygen atoms end up?
    
    **Key Benefits:**
    - The assessment directly aligns with the textbook's terminology and explanation
    - Questions cover exactly what students have learned from their course materials
    - The assessment follows the same conceptual organization as the textbook

    STUDENT ESSAY:
    "The Big Game"
    
    I was nervus the day of the big game. Me and my team had practiced 
    for weeks and weeks. We really wanted to win the championship! 
    
    When I got to the field, I saw so many people in the stands. My 
    heart was beating fast and my hands were shaking. My couch told us 
    to remember all the things we practiced. He said "Just do your best 
    and have fun." That made me feel a little better.
    
    The game started and the other team was really good. They scored a 
    goal in the first ten minutes and everyone on my team looked sad. 
    But I remembered what my mom always says about not giving up.
    
    In the second half I got the ball and passed it to my friend Tyler. 
    He kicked it to Jamie and she scored! Everyone cheered so loud! 
    The game was tied 1-1.
    
    With only five minutes left, I got the ball again. I saw an opening 
    and started running. I kicked the ball as hard as I could and it went 
    in the goal! We won the game 2-1 and everyone was jumping and screaming. 
    It was the best day ever and I learned that hard work pays off and 
    to never give up.

    # Feedback on "The Big Game"
    
    Dear Writer,
    
    I enjoyed reading your narrative about the championship game! You've created an exciting story with a clear message about perseverance. Here's my feedback based on our class rubric:
    
    ## Strengths
    
    **Organization (17/20)**: Your story has a clear beginning that sets up your nervousness, a middle that shows the challenge of the opposing team scoring, and a satisfying end with your winning goal. Your paragraphing helps the reader follow the sequence of events nicely.
    
    **Voice (18/20)**: You have a genuine, authentic voice that sounds like a real 6th-grade student experiencing an important moment. Phrases like "my heart was beating fast and my hands were shaking" help readers connect with your feelings.
    
    **Theme/Message (19/20)**: Your conclusion about how "hard work pays off and to never give up" comes through clearly in your story. You showed this theme through both the team's comeback and your personal triumph.
    
    ## Areas for Growth
    
    **Conventions (14/20)**: I noticed a few spelling and grammar errors that could be fixed with careful proofreading:
    - "nervus" ‚Üí "nervous"
    - "couch" ‚Üí "coach"
    - Several missing commas in dialogue
    
    **Development (15/20)**: While you included some great details about how you felt, you could make the story even more vivid by adding:
    1. More sensory details - What did the field smell like? What sounds did you hear besides cheering?
    2. Expanded dialogue - Instead of only quoting your coach briefly, consider adding more conversation between teammates
    
    ## Revision Suggestions
    
    1. **First Priority**: Proofread carefully for spelling and grammar. Try reading your story aloud to catch errors.
    
    2. **Second Priority**: Add 3-5 more descriptive details that use different senses (sight, sound, smell, touch).
    
    3. **Third Priority**: Expand one moment in more detail - perhaps the moment you scored the winning goal. How exactly did it feel? What exactly did your teammates do?
    
    I can see your hard work in this story, and your excitement about the game comes through clearly. With some careful editing and added details, this will be an even more engaging narrative!
    
    **Key Benefits:**
    - The feedback directly applies the specific class rubric to the student's work
    - Comments reference actual examples from the student's writing
    - Suggestions are age-appropriate and focused on the most important improvements
    - The analysis creates a fair, balanced assessment based on established criteria

    st.markdown("""
    This example shows how Reference Materials work together with Persona, Context, Task, and Format to create a comprehensive, powerful prompt:
    
    ```
    Persona: As an experienced high school physics teacher who explains complex concepts 
            through real-world applications and uses scaffolded instruction
    
    Context: For an 11th-grade physics class studying circular motion and centripetal force. 
            Most students have strong math skills (through Algebra 2) but struggle with 
            applying formulas to real-world scenarios.
    
    Task: Create a guided problem-solving worksheet
    
    Format: Structure the worksheet with:
           1. A brief review of key concepts and formulas (1 paragraph)
           2. A worked example with step-by-step reasoning
           3. 4 practice problems of increasing difficulty with hints
           4. A real-world application question as a challenge
    
    Reference: Base the content on our textbook's explanation of centripetal force:
              "Centripetal force is defined as the force that is necessary to keep an
              object moving in a curved path and that is directed inward toward the center
              of rotation. The magnitude of centripetal force on an object of mass m moving
              at speed v in a circle of radius r is given by: F = mv¬≤/r
              
              Examples of centripetal force include:
              - The tension in a string when swinging an object in a horizontal circle
              - The gravitational force on a satellite in circular orbit
              - The force of friction on a car making a flat turn
              - The normal force on a roller coaster at the bottom of a loop
              
              For an object to remain in circular motion, this force must be continuously
              applied. If the force ceases, the object will continue in a straight-line path
              tangent to the circle at the point where the force was removed (Newton's First Law)."
    ```
    
    **Benefits of Including References:**
    - The worksheet will use the exact terminology and formula notation from the textbook
    - Examples will be consistent with those students have already seen
    - Practice problems will match the textbook's approach to applying the formula
    - The physics concepts will be explained using the same framework students are learning from

    * Different types of references serve different educational purposes
    
    **Discussion Questions:**
    
    * What curriculum documents, standards, or textbooks do you regularly reference that could be included in prompts?
    * How might including reference materials help ensure AI-generated content is appropriate for your specific teaching context?
    * What types of student work might benefit from AI analysis using your established rubrics or criteria?

    ### Real-World Hook
    
    Research shows that specific, actionable feedback is one of the most powerful tools for improving 
    student learning, with effect sizes ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). However, 
    providing personalized, high-quality feedback to every student is time-consuming. Similarly, creating 
    engaging writing prompts that develop specific skills requires significant creative energy. With effective 
    prompt engineering, you can generate individualized feedback and powerful writing tasks more efficiently, 
    allowing you to maintain high-quality instructional practices while saving valuable time.

    In this lesson, we'll focus on applying prompt engineering techniques to two essential teaching tasks:
    
    1. **Student Feedback**: Providing personalized, growth-oriented responses to student work
    2. **Writing Prompts**: Creating engaging writing tasks that develop specific skills and knowledge
    
    These applications build on the techniques you've learned throughout the course:
    
    - **The PTC-FREI Framework**: Especially valuable for structuring complex feedback and writing tasks
    - **Role Prompting**: Creating appropriate voice and tone for different feedback situations
    - **Chain-of-Thought**: Modeling thinking processes for students in feedback
    - **Few-Shot Examples**: Ensuring consistency across multiple feedback instances

    Effective feedback should:
    
    - Be specific and actionable

    - Connect to learning goals and success criteria
    - Identify strengths as well as areas for growth
    - Provide clear next steps for improvement
    
    By using prompt engineering techniques, you can generate feedback that incorporates 
    these principles while tailoring responses to individual students and assignments.

    When designing prompts for feedback generation, consider including these elements:

    |-------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
    | **Acknowledgment** | Recognize effort or specific achievement | "Begin with recognition of the student's effort on [specific aspect]" |
    | **Strength Identification** | Highlight what was done well | "Identify 2-3 specific strengths in the work, with examples from their submission" |
    | **Growth Areas** | Identify opportunities for improvement | "Suggest 1-2 key areas for improvement that would have the most impact" |
    | **Specific Guidance** | Provide actionable next steps | "Offer concrete strategies or examples for addressing each growth area" |
    | **Connection to Goals** | Link feedback to learning objectives | "Connect feedback to the learning objective of [specific goal]" |
    | **Forward-Looking** | Focus on future application | "Include a challenge question or next step that extends their thinking" |

    | **Narrative** | Tells a story, real or imagined | "Create a prompt with a compelling scenario, character, or conflict starter" |
    | **Informative/Explanatory** | Conveys information clearly | "Develop a prompt that requires explaining a concept, process, or phenomenon" |
    | **Argumentative** | Makes a claim supported by evidence | "Design a prompt with a debatable issue and requirements for evidence types" |
    | **Analytical** | Examines parts of a whole | "Create a prompt requiring analysis of text, data, or media with specific focus areas" |
    | **Creative** | Emphasizes imagination and expression | "Generate a prompt with creative constraints that spark imagination while developing skills" |
    | **Reflective** | Explores personal thoughts and experiences | "Design a prompt that connects content to personal experiences or learning journey" |

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * Emphasize that AI-generated feedback should be reviewed and personalized by the teacher before being shared with students
    * Point out that prompt engineering for feedback can help ensure consistency across multiple students while still allowing for personalization
    * Suggest using these techniques for creating exemplars that show students what good writing looks like in response to prompts
    * Remind participants that effective feedback focuses on growth and improvement, not just evaluation
    
    **Implementation Ideas:**
    
    * Start with a smaller writing task or subset of student work to practice using AI for feedback
    * Consider creating a bank of writing prompts for different standards that can be used throughout the year
    * Use AI-generated writing prompts as starting points that can be refined and customized
    * Combine feedback templates with student-specific observations for efficient yet personalized responses

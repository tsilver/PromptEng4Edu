        3. **Specify cognitive level** - Clarify whether you need recall, application, analysis, etc.
        
        4. **Consider your student population** - Note any specific needs of your student demographic

        - **Efficiency of Zero-Shot**: You don't need to provide specific examples
        
        - **Clarity and Specificity**: The combination produces highly targeted content
        
        - **Contextual Relevance**: Persona and context elements customize the output to your specific needs
        
        - **Educational Alignment**: Reference materials ensure curricular alignment
        
        Remember that while this prompt is longer than a basic prompt, the additional specificity leads to higher quality results that need less editing, saving you time overall.

    **Teaching Tips:**
    
    * For Activity 1, encourage participants to consider the specific needs of their classrooms when transforming the prompts
    * For Activity 2, suggest starting with content types they regularly create to make the activity immediately practical
    * For Activity 3, emphasize that combining PCTFREI with zero-shot prompting offers a powerful balance of structure and efficiency
    
    **Common Challenges:**
    
    * Some participants may struggle to add specificity without adding examples - remind them to focus on parameters, not samples
    * Others may create overly complex prompts - encourage clarity and focus on the most important elements
    * Participants may need to be reminded that different subject areas benefit from different types of parameters
    
    **Extension Ideas:**
    
    * Have participants exchange zero-shot prompts and evaluate them for specificity and likely effectiveness
    * Challenge participants to create a "prompt template" with key parameters for a content type they frequently create
    * Encourage experimentation with different combinations of PCTFREI elements to find the optimal balance

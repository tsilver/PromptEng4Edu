# Prompt Engineering Course for Educators

A comprehensive Streamlit-based course that teaches educators how to effectively use Large Language Models (LLMs) in their teaching practice using the PTC-FREI framework.

We want to avoid 'artificial' intelligence that seeks to supplant human reasoning and leads to a loss of critical thinking skills.
  
We are seeking to augment and amplify human creativity and critical thinking with Generative AI.

## Course Overview

This course guides educators through the fundamentals of prompt engineering, providing practical examples and interactive exercises relevant to educational contexts.

### Course Structure

The course is organized into 17 lessons:

1. **Quick Start Guide**: Introduction to LLMs and Basic Prompting
2. **The Power of Context**: Understanding how context influences LLM outputs
3. **Defining the Task**: Creating clear task instructions in prompts
4. **Specifying the Format**: Controlling the output structure
5. **Defining the Persona**: Creating character and role-based prompts
6. **Incorporating References**: Using external materials
7. **Evaluation**: Assessing and improving LLM outputs
8. **Iteration**: Refining prompts for better results
9. **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Leveraging LLM knowledge without examples
10. **Few-Shot Prompting**: Guiding LLMs with examples
11. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Breaking down complex reasoning
12. **Role Prompting**: Using personas effectively
13. **Prompting for Lesson Planning and Assessment Creation**
14. **Prompting for Student Feedback and Writing Prompts**
15. **Prompting for Discussion Questions and Content Creation**
16. **Prompting for Email Composition and Presentation Outlines**
17. **Comprehensive Review and Integration**

Each lesson includes:
- Introduction to key concepts
- Practical examples
